I came across the Royal Hotel in Chilliwack.  The more I researched, the more intrigued I was.  We love historic buildings and appreciate when the owners refurbish them--preserving them for my kids and beyond.  \nWe weren't sure whether we would be able to make Chilliwack tonight, given we were coming down from the snow belt... and another storm was on the way.  So I wasn't comfortable making an online reservation.  \nAlong the way--once we felt we'd have a chance to arrive tonight (6+ hours driving...), I gave them a call.  The lady I talked to, Laura, was so refreshingly professional--and just plain Nice.  I explained our situation, and that we really wanted to stay at the Royal.  Asked if they had the room we wished (double-queen beds)--Yes.  How much?  The price she quoted was less by a few dollars than their best online rate (their website).  (Perhaps she gave us a special weekday senior rate--so appreciated.)  Then I explained I couldn't reserve since we were still 4 hours away...and couldn't guarantee we wouldn't run into a situation requiring we stay elsewhere.  She said that would be no problem--no credit card required--just call if something came up, she requested. (I'm a long-time world traveler--and I can tell you that kind of understanding and courtesy is seldom extended anymore.)  \nWe arrived--and could not believe how great this hotel is.  The wonderful wood \""grand\"" staircase leading upstairs from the lobby.  (No, there\u2019s no elevator. But they are happy to help with luggage if needed, according to the website.)  \nThere are wonderful rich wood accents and period furnishing in the lobby and meeting room next door.  A very kind and accommodating lady checked us in...giving us a lovely room in the \""bank\"" wing.  The room is on the second floor, and very nicely appointed.  Clean, quality linens, duvets, great pillows and comfortable, well-padded (but not too soft) mattresses, thick towels.  Nice quality room furnishings and a spotless bath.  (Some of the rooms [we are told!] offer claw foot soaking tubs with shower --next time!).\nWe were given a receipt to take to the cafe (another part of the hotel) for our hot breakfast--some very nice selections: eggs\u002Fchoice of meat\u002Ftoast), scramble on wrap; yummy French toast; Oatmeal \""plus\""...just to name a few!  \nWe haven't had breakfast yet--but definitely have high expectations--we had dinner this evening in the \""Pub\"" (which shares the Cafe kitchen) and have to say it was some of the best dining we've experienced.  Nice ambiance - informal - a place your kids can come too (think of English pubs where kids are welcome).  \nI had fish tacos (yummy--and lots of NOT greasy fries).  Hubby had one of their Everything burgers...these are really hamburgers, folks!  There's a reason the napkin you are given is extra thick.  Lots of other selections too--and some nice offerings for starters and other pub-grub!  Reasonably quick service, given there was one server and another individual tending bar and helping out a bit.  Locals like this place and I can see why.  Reasonably priced and ample servings.\nOn a side note\u2014but an important one at that:  An employee, noticing our interest in our surroundings, took great pride showing us around, and said the Hotel is the pride and job of a local family\u2014who are directly responsible for the preservation of this heritage property\u2014and then sharing it at a reasonable price with people like you and me.

One staffer did get back to me about it, but when I replied to her I found she had gone on vacation.  I tried the back up person who got back to me once, but did not get back to me after I replied.  I inquired again and she did not reply.  By that time there weren't any rooms left on the hotel's website and only those of us who found it on booking.com got rooms at the hotel.  Needless to say I was unable to book a dinner there.\nCheck in was not good.  I made the reservation in my name but my husband's credit card was the one we were using.  So they got that information asking him to complete a form, then asked me for ID!  Not in a really nice way either.\nLater my husband had a headache.

I said yes, but she didn't inquire what it was showing me that she didn't really care.  Later she took orders.  The food came out one or two items at a time until two people, including my husband and my mother (whose 85th birthday we were in town to celebrate), did not get their meals.  The rest of us were starting to eat as the food was getting cold and about five minutes later the server came along and asked if everything was okay. I said no and showed her that two people had nothing.  She asked what they had ordered!  She took the orders!  We told her.  It was obvious that the meals had not been made.  My husband's meal came out but not my mother's.  My little 85 year old mother was sitting there with no food while all the rest of us had food.  It was highly embarrassing. The server finally brought my mother her toast and one scrambled egg and apologized.  It was very poorly arranged and I was not happy.  The server made some very minor adjustments to the bill as a result, but I could not recommend this hotel to other travelers.

We had no idea how many would be attending so we settled with a number of 75 to be safe, They reduced the rate of the hall as more relatives were coming from out of town to stay there as well. The hall was $350 for the use of 4 hrs the catering would be priced at $2600+ for Coffee\u002F Tea, juice and finger foods, I now wished I would of taken a picture of the food provided and the servers that were to look over us. 1 tray of sandwiches, 1 tray of veggies and dip, 1 tray of 72 small samosas and 72 meatballs and 1 tray of fresh fruit. That's it and that's all for $2600+ well I'm know Einstein but there is no way that would amount to $2600 unless it was flown in from France or something, I feel they took advantage of a very caring family during a sad chapter in their life at the loss of their Father. The servers were young people not even trained in the proper etiquette of serving, at one point I had to address the front desk that the young lad looking over us has to be told that he can't just zone in on people and take their plate from under them while they still had food in their hands and on their plate, at least not without first asking if they were even finished with their plate.

The hotel only has 1 commercial toaster and this was (according to the staff) being used for \""function breakfasts\""  so 40 fishermen at 6.30 were presented with a single 4 slot domestic toaster which took on average 5 minutes to toast 4 slices  - surely a hotel should have more than 1 commercial toaster or at least go and buy another 3 domestic toasters!\n\nThe bag lunches have significantly worsened since my trip to The Coast 2 years ago $12 provides you an inedible sandwich or roll, an unripe apple or pear, a trail bar and a bottle of water - never again.\n\nWe unfortunately had a power cut night 2 due to a fire nearby, appreciate that this was not the hotels fault, but the power cut lasted until 11am the next day which meant that there was no lights in the room, no breakfast or bag lunches (which was no bad thing - see above).

Our granddaughter was born in December and this was going to be our first chance to see her. We made the mistake of checking into this place.\n\nThere had been a horrific wind storm the night we arrived. This of course is not the fault of the hotel but I never slept because the wind kept hitting something which banged all night...loudly. I never said a word but in the morning I told my wife that I would have to catch some sleep before seeing our little bundle of joy. We ate at the restaurant in the hotel and suddenly there were some fire alarms going off. This wasn't a big deal because we all know that fire alarms need to be tested and it takes a minute or two. Wrong. My wife went to visit and I went to sleep. Except the fire alarm testing went on and on and on and on. I kept trying to sleep which was impossible but figured it had to be over soon. Wrong. It went on until about 3 or 4 in the afternoon. I finally called down to the front desk. We are not complainers but this was ridiculous. I received a sort of apology. The clerk offered to refund one of our two days. I told her that the main concern was not about the money but about our expectations of peace and quiet. I didn't say that I didn't want the money since this visit was such a disaster. And, when I checked out, you guessed it, no refund but another tepid apology. This is what upsets me from the hotel perspective. Chances are that the hotel had scheduled these tests and knew they would be taking place. If we were told that when we checked in we could have gone elsewhere. Also, when the tests were due to happen guests were not notified. Not a notice under the door or a phone call. There never was any warning that these tests were for a full day. I know that most guests visiting would maybe be out for the day checking out the sights or visiting. But not everyone.

We called front desk and asked for a replacement.  They promptly sent us a replacement.  We tried to make coffee again and after twenty minutes of brewing, we realized that it was broken.  We called again and asked for another replacement.  They promptly sent us another one-this time a new one.  Finally, one of us enjoyed a cup of coffee lol.  Then we realized that they only provided two packets of single cup coffees in our room.  We had paid $51 usd ($67 cdn) extra to add two guests to our room... so you would think they would have provided coffee for four people, but no.  At this point, we didn't want to call front desk and ask for more coffee because we didn't want to bother them anymore.\nBut unfortunately we had to call them again because it what then that we realized that our pool noodles tied in a big bad, a bottle of wine and four bottles of water were missing.  We figured that housekeeping had taken them because we hadn't left anything else in the room and that they had assumed that we had checked out.  We called front desk about it and they asked which brand of wine it was (I didn't know because it was a gift and just told them it was red wine with a red colored twist cap-although i did know that the bottled water was save on food brand bottled water) and they said they would look into it and call us back.  They did call back and told us that they reviewed the security footage and housekeeping wasn't holding anything that looked like a pool noodle and that there was nothing they could do.  I told them that it wouldn't look like pool noodles on screen because they were stuffed into a maroon colored bag.  So the lady told me to speak to the manager in the morning. \nLosing two noodles, a bottle of wine, and bottled water is not a big deal but it just made us feel uneasy during the rest of our stay.  We also felt like we were treated like we were making stuff up when the lady at front desk said there was nothing that resembled a pool noodle in the security footage.  \nSo, already we were not feeling that great about our stay and i drop my phone behind the nightstand.  I had to push the nightstand forward by and couple inches to reach in and the only thing i picked up was a piece of garbage from a prior guest (a disposable lid from a fruit cup) to which I threw in the garbage can.  I pulled the nightstand out a couple more inches to find my phone (yay), more garbage from prior guests (a twisty tie, piece of plastic bag, and ear plug packaging, and whole lot of dust.  I picked up my phone, cleaned it up and left the garbage as it was.\nIt wasn't all bad.  We did enjoy a number of things about this place.  The beds are very comfortable.  The linens were very clean and comfy as well.  The rooms were quiet so we all got a good night's rest.  We took advantage of the pool and hot tub (which are on level 2).  There is good free wifi (the password is: canada).  There is plenty of shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and lotion to go around because they are provided in larger sized pump bottles.\nAt check out the next morning, the front desk person said that they had located the pool noodles, bag and bottle of wine.  But the bottles of water were missing.  They replaced the bottles of water.  Like I said, the lady that checked us out was very kind and apologized about the situation which i appreciated.  \nThings I would CHANGE about this place:  (A) They need to make sure that housekeeping no longer just assumes that guests have checked out and clears items at their own discretion.  (B) If a room has four guests booked in it, please provide four coffees, four coffee cups, four water cups, etc.",3,negative

It was a slightly unusual check in as the woman asked if we wanted house keeping performed during our stay. \nThe room was a standard hotel room. It had plenty of space, practical furnishings and a big king bed but was otherwise very bland. The furniture was basic blonde wood. There was a big bar fridge in the middle of the room and a big chunky air conditioning unit in the wall. The bedding had some marks but was comfortable. This was a four star hotel and the only one in the area but the quality was lacking. The room did not have a view of the pond, rather over the city and to the mountains. The bathroom was quite small but functional. The bath was rather small and cramped and not comfortable at all. \nSleep quality was poor. We spent various parts of the night awake due to the noisy location. We turned our air conditioner off because it was so loud, but this meant the room got warm and stuffy. Plus we could hear the neighbours' air conditioner and even him sneezing. Outside was traffic noise and ambulance sirens. The poor soundproofing did not make for a great sleep. However the bed was comfy and the pillows ok. \nBreakfast was a mixed affair. It was available from an early 6.30am but the offering varied. The hotel used the dreaded voucher system which we have found greatly limits what might be offered for breakfast. On the first morning there was a large crowd and we could order one item off the menu. By way of drinks coffee was included but OJ was extra. On the second morning when there was no crowd there was what was referred to as a Canadian breakfast which was a small \""buffet\"" of eggs, streaky bacon and diced potatoes and toast. It was the smallest buffet we had ever seen.\nUpon checkout and when asked how our stay had been we commented on the noise disturbance and how that impacted our comfort. The receptionist seemed surprised by this and was apologetic and to her credit she deducted the food portion of our first nights' dinner bill in consideration for this, which saved us sixty dollars. It was an unexpected and considerate gesture. \nOverall whilst not particularly expensive this hotel barely gives you what you pay for.",2,negative

Our room was large and nice enough but there were noticable scuffs on the wall and the bathroom had definitely seen better days (terrible old shower for a 3.5 star hotel).

This was the only place in town that had a full kitchenette and would take the direct payemnts. I was a little dubious going in as I had never stayed here before nor had I heard of anyone staying here. I now know why. \n   The room they put us in did not have the full kitchenette that was advertised first off. There was no oven, a very small bar sink and small bar fridge. They did provide a hot plate but it only had two settings. On and off. Not easy to control heat for cooking anything beyond boiling water. When we checked in we found a large hole in the wall of the bathroom. We immediately told the front desk to ensure we were not faulted for this later. The over all condition of the room was OK but nothing great. \n    We noticed that the light in the kitchen area came on and off on its own. When the switch was turned on, it would come on for about 15 minutes or so, the automatically turn off. It would stay off for at least 20 minutes to a half hour, then come back on. It seems it was in some way over heating and needed to cool off before it would come back on. This was a bit of an issue due to the fact that ther lighting in the room was so sparse. Even with all the lights on and the windows open, it was still dark in the room. Needless to say, we had to keep the light on in the bathroom by the kitchen in order to see anything we were doing in the kitchen. \n    The maid service wasn't exactly stellar. We opted to only have them come in every 3rd day, as we didn't need to be waited on all of the time. Even as such, most of the time, the bed was made and the garbages were emptied. That was about it. Only once could we tell that a vacuum had been run through the place. The bathroom toilet was never cleaned to the point where my wife had enough and brought some cleaner and did it herself. Only so much you can take. \n   We also noticed that the drains throughout the place were very slow draining. The bathroom sink would always fill up as you were washing and take about 2 minutes after you were done to finish draining. The shower was worse and you couldn't shower for more than 10 minutes before you had to stop or it would over flow. The bar sink was the same but after the first two weeks ( as we were there for 2 1\u002F2 weeks ) it was getting slower until it stopped draining at all. At this point I finally called the front desk but only to ask that the drain be unclogged and maybe the light in the kitchen checked. I figured don't fool with electricity. Well, the front desk clerk did say she would have someone come and look at the issues mentioned but spent at least 2-3 minutes insinutating that I should have called sooner and let them know of the issues. I did admit we could have called about the little issues as we first came across them but in truth I figured it was just the way the hotel was and was willing to live with it. Still didn't appreciate being made to feel as if it was my fault that the problems existed and that I was responsible for ensuring they were reported. Do they not have staff that goes into those rooms Daily ( or in our case every 3rd day ) to clean? would they not have noticed the light not working, or the drains not draining? Unless they didn't actually do any washing or cleaning. Hmmm. \n  Anyway after all of that, we talked to insurance and were able to change hotels. Enough is enough.

The cost per night was reasonable.   Entrance to the rooms are on the outside of the building which has it's advantages if you have dogs. We were given a ground floor room. We could park the car right outside the door. The room was big enough for all of us and it was clean, if a little dark, as the window at the front was quite small.  We had a Fridge, a microwave and a flat screen TV. There was a little lobby area opposite the bathroom with a unit with cupboards and counter top which was handy. There was also a safe.

Two-story motel that's definitely worn-out, although the layout is very interesting with an atrium area that has little streams, fountains and a small pool.

Half of the rooms face the atrium, and some of the ground-floor rooms have sliding doors that open directly onto the pool area.

Price was right.\nRooms were clean, staff was great.\n\nMy only complaint is that they use major scented cleaners (probably carpet deodorizer) and I have petrochemical allergies. There is no reason for a room to smell that strong unless you are trying to cover something foul up and this does not seem to be the case here as the carpeting is fine and the room and rest of the inn was clean.\n\nI had to take Benadryl to be able to breath. Thankfully it was not strong enough to require an epi pen.   \n\nWe opened the window and ran the air conditioner nonstop and I could still smell it the following evening, even though we did not have the room cleaned in between.\n\nI realize this is my fault for not asking ahead of time for an unscented room but quite honestly in all my years of traveling I have only encountered one other room that smelled this strong - a roach motel in Tahoe which we promptly left. \n\nWe probably would have tried to go elsewhere except I booked nonrefundable online and we'd had a long ferry ride and drive in from Nanaimo. \n\nSince the hotel prides itself on being \""green\"", I would recommend going beyond recycling, water conservation and so on to include the use of environmentally friendly and nontoxic cleaners.

The hotel is dated and frayed around the edges like an old blanket that you refuse to throw out.  Our room was clean, but again dated and the bedding was worn thin.  The worst was an overpowering stench of room deodorizer that would just not dissipate.  It was as though they were trying to cover up the smell of a dead body with 80 cans of Febreeze.  The smell was so strong that both of us had trouble sleeping, but we couldn't open the door to the atrium because it was Saturday night and the bar was in full swing.  The walls are so thin we could hear the man snoring in the room next to us, and follow every conversation in the room below us. The bar noise didn't shut down until after 1 am, and the noise of the drunk patrons lasted til well after 2 am .  We didn't get to sleep until after 3am and was then woken up brutally by house keeping at 9am. My advice is to ensure you get a room facing away from the atrium if you want any sleep.

The full restaurant was finally opened but too late to accommodate all the people coming in. Although the staff were working very hard trying to keep the tables cleaned and the food restocked, it was stressful as a guest to try and fit in, while seeing tons of empty tables closed nearby. \n\nThe other issue I have is that breakfast starts early at 6:30 am and ends at 9:30 am. Anyone on holiday is hoping to be able to relax and take some time to enjoy themselves. Being forced to get up and go eat early and then go swim on a full stomach before checking out is annoying. What would work better would be to have the pool open by 6:30 or 7:00 am (for adults only so the kids don't wake anyone) and keep the breakfast time open until 10:30 am.

No special salads, the hot items (with the exception of the salmon) were past it and not very nice at all, the desserts looked like they really stepped it up and brought a bunch from a Save On sale (the jello cups were good), waffles & pancakes were luke warm and the strawberry topping was very bad (not real strawberries, rather a jam of some kind which was so bad, I couldn't eat it.... and I can eat almost anything!).

Our room, not all that far from the construction going on at the hotel entrance, was pretty quiet, reflecting management's effort to build the work schedule around the comfort of guests (e.g. not starting too early or finishing too late). \n\nThe furnishings were nice to look at and comfortable to sit in or sleep in. Everything worked well, even if the room was a bit on the small side. Well appointed furnishings do make a difference. The bath, also clean and new, had a good shower with a massaging shower head, something we appreciated after hours on the road. We were happy here and slept well.\n\nThe main construction-related issue was that breakfast had to be served in a cleared and reconfigured standard bedroom, since the breakfast room itself was apparently part of the renovation project. The space was pretty cramped, but help was on hand to make sure everyone got served what he or she wanted, and the hot breakfast was good and plentiful. Guests were given trays to take food and drink back to their rooms, which was perfectly fine as far as we were concerned.  \n\nWe did note that one guest who arrived in a wheel chair could not easily be accommodated in the small, busy space, but her companion jumped in to handle everything for her.  Had it been necessary, we are certain that the helpful staff would have provided that service. The people who work here seemed to go out of their way to make up for any issues connected with the renovation and, in my book, they succeeded beautifully.\n\nLet me note that the hotel is located in a shopping center, which proved useful, as we had some shopping to do and could easily dispatch with it. In addition, the staff recommended we try dinner at The White Spot right nearby, and this turned out to be a wonderful experience, with a special summer-themed menu featuring local food products including wines of British Columbia. I've attached pictures of the special menu, \""Celebrate BC - Summer Is Being Served!\""  What a great idea! The dishes were tasty and imaginative, way above the boring standardized fare one usually finds along a major travel route. \n\nThis restaurant was part of a small, locally owned chain with a long history, a great reputation, and delectable, well-put-together fresh food.

He asked for the government rate and when asked if it was provincial or federal and who it is through, he indicated federal working for the RCMP. As he had called the hotel direct, they indicated that we were on file as we had stayed there before. He was given the rate and my husband provided our credit card number to hold the room. \n\nWe arrived at 2 pm on Saturday to check in.  The clerk informed us our room was not ready as check in is at 3 pm.  She asked for our phone number, said she would request it be prepared as soon as possible and would call us when it is ready.  We gave her our cell number and informed her we would go for lunch at the IHOP next door.  We had not received a call by 2:55 pm so we went to check.  The room was ready and while there was no mention of the phone call, my husband proceeded to check in. She attempted to charge our credit card, and because we had just returned from attending our daughter\u2019s wedding in the Caribbean, we were not sure if our payment had reached our credit card company yet, so when it declined we offered to leave the credit card number and pay a deposit from our debit card.  We have done this in the past with other hotels and never had an issue.  After all, they have my husband\u2019s police identification and our credit card on file for any future charges.  The credit card deposit was only $100 while the cash\u002Fdebit deposit was $300.  Still, we did not hesitate as our intention is to enjoy our stay, not to trash the room or steal anything so we felt confident we would have our deposit returned. The clerk told us very clearly that to get our deposit back we would need to provide picture identification upon check out.  This too seemed strange as I know that if you provide a deposit on a debit card, the refund MUST go back on the same debit card.  So why would it matter who presented the debit card? \n\nWe checked into our room at approximately 3 pm.  I stayed in the room to have a nap while my husband left to attend to other business.  He returned at 6 pm to pick me up to attend an evening church function.  We returned to the hotel at 10 pm, to eat in our room, watch tv and go to sleep.  Sunday morning we awoke at 7:30 am to use the pool and hot tub. At 9 am my husband attempted to check out while I finished getting ready.  He was informed they would need to inspect the room before returning our deposit. We thought this was a little odd as we\u2019d been quiet and respectful during our stay and even while we were swimming we know they can watch us on video so we were wondering why they would assume we would do anything to the room. We had also been issued the room closest to the front desk so if we had done any damage, they would surely have heard it.  We had no issue the last time we stayed in the hotel, so we were wondering why they seemed to be treating us this way.  We know it is just policy because of the debit deposit, but it all seemed strange, we\u2019d never encountered this in the past with Travelodge or any other hotels. At 9:45 my husband again went to the front desk to tell them we were leaving and ask if they could do the inspection. We were on our way to church for 10 am and did not want to be late. The clerk again informed him that she could not do the inspection until we were completely out of the room.  He said that I was right behind him so she left the front desk and came back to tell him that she would have to wait until I was out of the room.  In the meantime, I started to have a sick feeling about the whole situation and was concerned so I took a couple of minutes to take pictures of the room, how we left it.  I have the pictures if they are required for future evidence. I left the room, proceeded to the front desk and expressed my sincere disappointment in the way we were being treated.  I told the clerk that they know my husband is a police officer with the RCMP and while we do not expect special privilege, why would he or we risk him losing his job over a stolen towel or a trashed room? They also have our credit card number that they could charge in the future if they notice something missing or damaged.  We are average people in our 40\u2019s, we look clean and we act respectful, we gave no indication of any problems AND we have stayed with your hotel before with no incident, if this is policy, it seems ridiculous.  As well, if they suspected we would do something to the room, why were they not concerned about leaving us alone at the front desk while they checked the room?  Might I add that if you are so concerned about judging people, you may want to enforce that your staff look professional.  It is hard to take a male staff member seriously when they look like someone who is going to attend a rock concert or be part of a circus rather than work at your front desk.  \n\nAfter discussion about this incident with our friends, we found out that they have had issues while staying at this hotel.  One indicated that there was what looked like a gang causing problems one evening during their stay, and the staff did nothing about it.  We were also informed by our church Pastor that the church stopped dealing with this particular hotel previously because of problems they have had.  In the past year, in my husband\u2019s profession, we have seen police officers targeted and killed senselessly.  We have been warned to be cautious, in our personal lives as well as professional.  It is now our opinion that this hotel is suspect.  We feel we may have been discriminated against BECAUSE my husband is police.  We will not stay at a Travelodge in Canada or anywhere because we now feel unsafe.",1,negative

Since I was planning on being out at the water park and the adventure park both days, I mistakenly chose one of the hotels in the Chilliwack area.Surprisingly, this area was quite booked up so there wasn\u2019t much of a choice in hotels in Chilliwack.  I picked this Travelodge as I\u2019ve stayed at Wyndham group of hotels and a Travelodge before and have always been satisfied, so I was hopeful.This was right off the #1 Trans Canada highway and even has an IHOP on site, which was convenient.

Our room, which was supposedly already an \u201Cupgrade\u201D, was equally disappointing.We were greeted with a musty mildew smell, and some uninvited guests of several dozen fruit flies.

You could hear a few noises outside of the room but that never bothers me anyway.  Besides, when you travel with a few hockey teams in this case, we expected it!  The breakfast was very nice too.  Nothing too fancy.  The standard fare for a continental breakfast but the egg omelettes was a nice touch.  Coffee served all day was fantastic!  Being at the rink all day and you really need a few cups to keep going!

First, the good:\n\n- New and fresh\n- Clean Rooms\n- Nicely furnished\n- Reasonable Prices\n\nBut now, the bad:\n\n- No Diamond recognition. Even the snack\u002F beverage that you are entitled to as Gold\u002F Diamond is not freely offered, but you have to request it - and in two cases the front desk staff seemed to be confused about the request\n- Handling of problems is atrocious. I had a room where the always-on bathroom fan produced an amount of noise that interfered with my sleep. I let them know after the first night and they promised to look into it. What did they actually do? Nothing. When inquiring with  the front desk person on check-out (same person that noted the issue), there was no real explanation offered and just a luke-warm apology given\n- TV Line-Up is a joke. 90% of channels that might be of interest just come back with a \""not subscribed\"" message. I am not talking about premium channels, btw.\n- It appears to be impossible to get into a room with just one bed and some kind of comfortable chair or sofa, even for a Diamond member with bed preference requested. As a business traveler, I really do not need two beds - but a comfortable chair to relax in the evening is important to me. I am not sure if they just don't have that type of room or if they simply don't care about requests from high-tier members\n\nGiven time, they may get their act together when it comes to frequently staying business travellers. Personally, I will give them quite some before trying again.",3,negative

I wrote my first positive review of the Hampton Inn when it was brand new in February 2014. Today I would add that the qualities mentioned back then still hold true. The only detractor that I noticed this time was the scarcity of food at the breakfast. It is a good breakfast but when the eggs and sausages and hash browns ran out there didn't seem to be any hurry in getting them refilled. I saw waves of families coming down, checking the empty buffet warming tray, and resorting to finding toast, cereals, etc. I felt compelled to give aheads up to the gal in the kitchen but the purpose of my stay was relaxation, not administration! ; ) In the last review I mentioned the Shandhar Hut Indian Restaurant in town and it remains outstanding.

On days when I didn't leave a tip, nothing was refilled (coffee, cups, shampoo, etc.). I don't like not leaving a tip - but sometimes don't have cash and\u002For only have large bills.

Once we got in our room we noticed how nice it was but we soon discovered the previous guest's popcorn under the curtains that housekeeping missed.

Next morning we went down to the breakfast room. It was full. There was nowhere to sit, at all. But there were a few tables of people who were just drinking coffee only. They would not leave so others could enjoy breakfast. As result, 4 of us had to carry our breakfasts and coffees back to our room on the third floor. The paper plates were thin and flimsy making it very difficult to carry in one hand and a hot coffee in the other. Why paper plates and plastic cutlery? Why are there no trays available? This was very frustrating. The staff in the breakfast area should take notice if there is no more room to sit. They should kindly asks guests to move on if they are just sitting there drinking coffee only. In addition, breakfast options were quite basic here, we expected more from this chain.

Based on reviews that we found on Trip Advisor, we decided that we would stay at the Hampton Inn.  Surprisingly, we found the hotel tucked away in a light industrial area just off the Trans Canada Highway.  But it is surrounded by trees and when on the property you do not feel that you are in this type of zone - and although we were there on a long weekend, we did  not hear any highway or other noise (i.e., passing trains) while in the hotel. \n\nOverall, we found our stay quite pleasant and the staff were very friendly.  We choose our room via early check-in (in response to an e-mail sent by Hampton Inns), and check in went very smoothly.   The rooms were clean, and the property looked to be well maintained.  Everything worked in our room, and any additional needs we had were quickly handled by the staff.  Water pressure in the bathroom was quite good, and the bathroom was large enough that you were not bumping into things as you moved about.   The beds were comfortable.\n\nThis property like many other Hampton Inns we have stayed at offered the standard breakfast buffet.  The food was fine, although some more variety on hot items would have been nice.  A second waffle maker would also have been nice.  The waffles were really good, but sometimes on some mornings the line-up to use the single waffle maker was too long to wait for them.  \n\nBecause of its location, travellers should know that there are very few restaurants within walking distance of this hotel.  There is what appears to be a fairly new burger place (Mooyah's) on the entrance driveway to the Hampton Inn, and a Tim Horton's nearby but other than that, you need a car or a taxi to get to areas of the city where there are more food choices.  \n\nNotwithstanding its location, the Hampton Inn Chilliwack is a property that we would stay at again should we come back to explore more of this area in the lower mainland in the future.",4,positive

And yes, if you go during spring break, it will be super busy, as most places would be. In terms of an earlier check in time, just ask when you make the reservation! I asked and was told I could check in at 2 (as opposed to 4).

The Jones Boys is a group of 4 somewhat older men who really know how to croon and make great music and it was sooo much fun dancing as well as watching other couples up dancing, obviously enjoying one another's company and having a wonderful time.

However, you are deemed a non hotel guest after 11:00 am checkout.  I have never had this type of poor customer service at any other hotels or motels.  It has been my experience that after checkout, you can check your luggage with the front desk and use the facilities (free of charge).

I did not have any expectations since I had no clue (sneaky but awesome boyfriend). We got there around 1 pm and were quite impressed when we heard that our room was already ready. We got a room on the 7th floor in the East Tower. Lobby was really great - the decor was very modern but still gave you a warm feeling.  We got to the room and bam! My boyfriend's face changes. The room itself was fine. Nothing fancy - old tv, plain bathroom. However, the view was not worth the price. We were facing the inside of the resort - therefore we could only see the other tower and the roofs of the lower buildings. I did not understand his disappointment until I found out he paid $250+ one night for it. The balcony was dirty with sun flower seeds everywhere. \nHowever, I have to applaud their customer service. My boyfriend went down and explained the situation and one of the administrators immediately found us a new room within 10 minutes. It was great to have someone understands our frustration and be sympathetic. It was a busy weekend (long weekend) and she took her time to make sure that we were satisfied.  Our new room was on the 6th floor and the view was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! we got to see the village and part of the lake. So much better than our old room.  \nWe went to check out the pools - they accommodated every age range. They have a water play ground at the back for children to run around in the water with fountains that shoot water; a deeper ones for children who want to learn how to swim as it was deep enough for adults to have a good swim in. And they have a beginner pool where you could see many babies and younger children getting used to being in the water while the moms can still suntan even while sitting with their children in the water. They have 2 indoor pools that we did not use but look pretty good from the outside. The best was the adult pool where the water was hot. Sitting on the lounge chairs there, you would think that you were somewhere exotic. One suggestion is to put more lounge chairs out there. Many people leave their belongings to reserve their seats while they go to the other pools (some for hours)! \nWe did not have dinner at the resort's restaurants. However, for those who have kids (or who still have a kid's heart), they do have a game room by the main restaurant. It was definitely fun to spend some time there after dinner. \nThe location of the resort is great - there is a rental place just in front of it and restaurants are literally walking distance. Overall a great trip, awesome customer service.",4,positive

This is the closest hot spring to where we live so we wanted it to work for us. The first person we talked to said all the pools were 100 degrees-not true. The small indoor pool is 104 and then they go to 100 and less in a couple of the other pools. The pools are chlorinated but the water is from their hot spring which is natural and can be seen about 500 meters from the hotel. The only other hot spring access in town is the public pool which is also owned by the hotel. \nWe have been told that you can access the pools with a 1 night stay for 24 hours from 1 pm till 1 pm the next day. Check in is not till 4pm so you could leave your luggage at the desk or in your car and use the pools complete with dressing room before  you went to your room at 4. Check out is 11 and you could get another 2 hours then till 1pm.\n \nThe rates do change so it is best to check rates for different times. The old or \""heritage\"" section that we were in is the least expensive and was fine when we were there but doesn't have AC so plan your trip accordingly. We had a lovely room overlooking the pool but you could just as easily end up with a room looking out to a wall or over a rooftop. The room did have a small refrigerator, great wireless internet, large closet, well laid out bathroom, spa towels and robes though. The carpets were a bit dirty but it was the end of the summer season so that may be the reason.\n\nWe got one of the packages that included dinner at the Copper room and a buffet breakfast. Both were fair but a bit expensive and there are other options in town.

Whenever I asked a simple question like where is a good place to dine for lunch since the hotel does not offer lunch service, the staff simply shook her head without eye contact, repeatedly said that the hotel does not offer lunch service, and walked away with the attitude of \""it's your problem and I don't give a damn.\""  I got the same sort of reaction from another staff when inquired about dinner alternatives besides the Copper Room.\n\nFor its value, the hotel is great for booking reservation and staying overnight.

Treat yourself to a spa treatment and you can play in the pools at no extra charge.\nSome of the rooms are very nice, and the lake front view is spectacular. No air conditioning in the west tower, which is a pain in the summer time. Bring a fan if temperature forecast is the high twenties or thirties.

The hotel is a bit of a mixed review, dependent on what one expects.  There are three parts to the hotel of varying age.  The East Tower and the West Tower are newer and cost marginally more.  The East Tower has larger rooms, most with balconies.  The Main area is the oldest and the rooms reflect an elegance from an earlier era.  We choose this part of the hotel because we can afford it and because it does have character. Anyone wanting a modern looking, larger room should choose the East or West Tower.  The main feature of the resort is the hot spring.  There are two indoor pools and several outdoor ones.  The water temperature is different in each of the pools, as is the mineral content.  Even though we went in mid-November, it was possible to enjoy most of the outdoor pools, as well as the indoor.  We went into the water several times a day.  The robes and extra towels that are provided make the pool experience even better.  As for other amenities, there is a spa - which we didn't see any need to pay for - a fancy, if somewhat expensive, restaurant - the Copper Room - for evening dining and dancing, a lounge that serves great drinks and some food, a good coffee bar, and a big lobby area for sitting and reading or playing games in, and the other obligatory gift shops, etc..  Every day at 4 PM, tea is provided in the main lobby area.  My only real gripe is that they don' t serve coffee and tea is not my \""cup of tea\"".  There are also pleasant walks both along the lake and through a bit of the wilderness area beside the hotel.  It isn't 4 or 5 star, but it doesn't cost that kind of money in the off season.  It is just a nice place for a getaway.  The breakfast included in our package was a very good buffet breakfast with most everything one could ask for.  Because we went in the off-season, the regular restaurant was not open; so, unless one is willing to pay the price for the Copper Room for supper, it is necessary to leave the hotel or eat the more limited fare in the lounge.  However, this is not really a problem since there are a number of other eating establishments with in a 10 minute walk of the hotel.  The rooms are clean, the staff has always been fabulous, and we have come away well satisfied.  There are a number of packages available with different options, including a Senior's package and a Family package.  The hotel does not offer a Christmas package that includes Christmas Day, which is when I would most like to be there.  If a person is expecting a luxurious, extravagant holiday, maybe consider somewhere else.  However, if a relaxing, pleasant break is what one is after, this has been a good choice for us.",4,positive

I explained that expedia Only allows you one option for a room.. but they kept messing me around and basically said to wait till I got there to see what was available and the cost. I did wait.. and they said nothing is available.!! great!! But what I found out through one person is that they sell there worse rooms through expedia with no real photos of it so you are stuck with it but the hotel gets to get rid of those rooms that way so it works for them!.

Until this hotel does an overall overhaul and modernizes  all the rooms there will be such inconsistent reviews because there are such vast differences in the rooms now and that can really effect ones individual\nexperience depending on what room you get. I have stayed at this Hotel over 10 x now.. everytime a different room~\nThere is a small bar off to the front in the lobby called the island bar and I LOVE IT the service is so great and the waiter and waitresses personalities are just over the top awesome!

The sign should reflect the LAKESIDES brunch schedule NOT the Copper Rooms.\nThere are so many great aspects though.. the pools are so nice and the robes they supply a nice touch the spa and staff great! but .. don't go there and sit in the pools thinking you are getting some therapeutic  treatment in the natural hotsprings~ the smell of  chlorine is so stong that you don't get any impression of a true hotsprings .. fresh mineral smells  like the ones in Iceland or the new one at whistler called Scandinavian Spa which is awesome! but has no accomodations. they need to cut back on the chlorine and add some ozonaters to get that mountain fresh smell infused throughout.  You come out of there with your skin peeling and all dry and itchy reeking of chlorine.. NOT therapeutic at all! I would never travel from far away to go here but for us its a 2 hour drive and worth it for a get away... I do prefer the summer time more though.. someday I hope to actually get a great room there! right now its a total gamble what you'll get.

So our Friday night room service trays (catering's responsibility, not housekeeping) were still in the hallway Sunday morning when we were checking out.  They were not alone - other people added to the pile. The other negative is the crowds in the pools, but you have to expect that!

I hadn't been to Harrison since my childhood so wanted to check out the renovations done to the hotel since then (which are more than I would care to admit).\n\nThe staff were friendly and efficient. No secured bike parking but they were okay with us bringing our bikes into our room which worked out fine for us.\n\nWe booked a room in the main hotel in order to experience the old part of the building. The room was clean and tidy. Walls were a bit thin and the noise from the outdoor pools carried but this was not unexpected given that we were in the older part of the hotel.\n\nRoom service was prompt and reasonably priced, though the food was nothing to rave about.

I should make a note that I'm not a huge fan of crowds, so my review reflects this preference. I think I prefer the intimate nature of hot tubs over large hot pools but again, I think this is a personal preference. The large hot pools at the hotel provide room for more people, which in the end is a good thing if everyone needs\u002Fwants to experience the hot springs. We only experienced outdoor \""adult\"" pool, but the other pools looked like a lot of fun for families. \n\n(Other things we noticed for families: water park within the facility and huge inflatable slides in the lake. I don't remember those when I was a kid, as I'm sure I would have found them to be a TON of fun!)\n\nBreakfast buffet was reasonable.

Here were the pros and cons of our stay:\n\nPros:\n- 3 outdoor pools, 1 indoor hottub and 1 indoor heated pool - so a lot of pools to choose from and they are all varying temperatures which was great.\n- They do have an adults only pool (which is great if you do not want to be directly around kids; however, you can still hear them!), but it is very small.  It was very weird when it became crowded in the afternoon, because it felt as if everyone just sat there staring at each other, especially those going in and out of the pool!\n- Superior room in West wing was very clean and very spacious (I expected it to be extremely outdated based on past reviews, but I think those reviews must be based on the main hotel wing, which I have heard is not very good).  There were still fixtures, wallpaper, etc in our room that definitely needed updating to make it truly worth the $250 a night!\n- The Islands Bar makes AWESOME martini's and have very kind servers!\n- The Lakeside Cafe made for a good lunch that was also reasonable priced (try their yam \nfries!!!); the servers were also very kind and pleasant!\n-The hotel provides you with robes that everyone walks around in.  They were handy to throw over your bathing suit and comfortable.\n\nCons:\n- We paid for a superior room with a \""pool view\"", except we didn't get a pool view at all (despite calling the hotel weeks before to verify our booking and to tell them that it was our wedding anniversary).  Our view was part of a roof from a neighboring building and a huge tree.  If you do get a \""pool view\"" make sure it is above the 2nd floor of the West tower.\n- The various Hotsprings pools are small, so it becomes very crowded by late afternoon.\n- Lots of kids, so if you prefer to relax without kids screaming in the background or in some cases, jumping all around you, this is not the place for you.\n- Pools were not very clean and were starting to show their age.  They should have a pool keeper that uses a net to remove all of the leaves and debris. (I grew up near a hotsprings and it was much cleaner than this).\n-There is not a lot of lounge chairs around the pools for the amount of people who frequent the pools by late afternoon.\n- The Copper Room restaurant made for a fun night of dinner and dancing, but we were extremely let down by the quality of food for the expensive price we paid.  The food was only average, if that, at best.  My husband had prime rib of which the majority was fatty and his Yorkshire pudding was literally burnt to a crisp (very dark brown and rock solid!)\n- This hotel is starting to show its age and at $250 a night, you would definitely expect better.  The hallways smelled very musty.\n\nAll in all, we had a pleasant experience - the pools are fun, but small and the rooms are still clean, if somewhat outdated.  We were especially disappointed with our room view for having paid extra and we most certainly, will not eat at the Copper room restaurant again - the quality of food most certainly did not match the price we paid for the evening.

The hot spring fed pools are by far the highlight of the trip, the bar service near the pool was reasonably priced and the lunch was good too. The buffet breakfast was very well done (omelet stations, good variety and friendly service), our pizza room service meal was excellent and overall the staff were friendly and helpful. This hotel is a fun experience in that the whole thing is different that almost any other place I have ever stayed with the 5 hot springs pools. You do pay a premium to stay here, however it costs at least $40 to take a family of 4 to the public springs pool and believe me the experience is not even close to the same (nice resort vs ratty public pool). \n\nMy advice would be to stay in the East or West towers unless you want to be super close to the pools and don't mind a dated, but cozy main hotel room.

We were totally disappointed! The hotel is by no means a health resort but a family hotel.\n\nThe original BUILDING is old and has been extended several times. We booked a room, lakeview, in the latest extension, the East Tower. Lakeview means facing north and above the entrance area. And that means the room was cold inspite of 25\u00B0C outside and loud. Especially caused by visitors of the lake with cars and motorbykes that were in search of a parking place. Why doesn't tthe hotel install a barrier to spare their guests this terrible noise? Especially at the weekend the hotel is in- and outside loud and crouded.\n\nThe ROOM is nice, 2 beds and normal equipment, balcony to the lakeside. The room was clean, the beds okay. The bathroom is a bit small. The banister of the balcony was cobwebbed and dirty. We noted that the building from the inside  in general was clean but windows and balconies were clearly neglected.\n\nRESTAURANTS: We had breakfast in the LAKESIDE CAFE. They offer only a well equipped buffet at $ 16.95\u002Fperson. Unfortunately there is not the possibility to order any other smaller breakfast such as Continental or \""just toast and coffee. They also are open for lunch, at the weekends they offer a Italian buffet.\nMany people used the \""MISS MARGRET's for breakfast, a little Coffee Shop with a few tables with bar stools. They also took their breakfast to the pool to eat it there. The ISLND BAR on the upper level of the lobby is rather a Caf\u00E9, opens at 2 pm and serves drinks and small dishes. The service here was very nice. For dinner we went to the COPPER ROOM, a very large room, old fashioned, with a band and a dance floor right in the middle. The atmosphere is formal. Very good food and service.\n\nPOOLS: There are 3 outdoor pools, a small one for adults only, and inside a small pool and nearby a round pool to sit in with up to 40\u00B0C hot spring water. The pool area was too small for all the guest, children were allowed even in the round pool with 40\u00B0.\nUsing the inside pools for health reasons was therefore restricted to the very early morning hours.\nAt no time we saw any supervisor of the hotel.\nThe windows of the indoor pools had not been cleaned for a long time. Number of sun loungers was insufficient. In the room is 1 pool towel provided for per person with the note that 25$ are charged in case of loss. \n\nSPA: We had several very good massages (Nicole and Yolanda).\n\nSERVICE: They try but could be better and quicker.",3,negative

The beds were clean as were the other furnishings -- it just seemed like someone was trying to do the minimum to upgrade when they really need to pull out some carpets and do an overhaul. \n\nSo I call down to get some spa services - they couldn't get me in in one block of time for all the services I wanted which was okay, but not the best. And they brochure that I was looking at (the one in the hotel room) was old enough that it referenced services that they no longer offer. \n\nBut then the kicker came in -- I was away in an area of the province without cell or internet reception, so was behind on communications -- I go to log into their internet service and the passwords didn't work. Strange - so I phone down to the reception, and ask about getting a different password. \n\n\""Sorry, that's all the passwords we have, you'll just have to wait for someone to stop using their internet and then you'll be able to log in\"". \n\nSo I asked again - thinking that can't be the response, \""So, when I'm asking for access, through the time that I'm here, I'm going to have to wait for someone to stop using their access and *then* log in? How is that a service offered?\""\n\n\""Well, it isn't guaranteed, it's complimentary\""\n\n\""Well, I booked this room based on having access to some sort of internet service -- I need to gain access\"". \n\n\""Sorry.\"" - Silence. \n\nSo I went to the main check-in and talked to the front staff there - and she was at least trying to come up with a response -- she suggested that I try accessing it in a different area of the hotel and it might then work in the room. So I wandered out, with my computer like an idiot, trying to find a 'hot spot' so I could be connected, but no luck. So I told her - I booked this hotel room as a break, but I also expect a basic access to internet. Saying it's not available is not acceptable. And she totally understood - and we adjusted the booking so I checked out the next morning. And so I cancelled all of the spa services that I booked as well. \n\nI would have thought at some point in this process that a manager would come out and try to resolve the situation - offer *something* as an apology. Nope. Nothing (at least yet). \n\nI was really looking forward to spending a couple of days here, and dropping probably a few bucks too- but if a hotel is too cheap to offer an internet hot spot with its supposed \""world class\"" facilities, then it doesn't get my business. \n\nMy suggestion is - if you have no other choices or if you have a massive family that you need to find a great deal for, and a great family-oriented facility, I'd say this is probably your space. If you are thinking - strangely, like I did- that this would be a good place to 'rest and relax', goodness gracious do not stay here. You'd have a better experience at a Super 8.",2,negative

We booked the Wet and Wild family package which included bumper boots on the lake and a trip to nearby water slides. It also included breakfast. We tried to extend the package by two days which created alot of problems. At first they forgot a day in between which got caught; but then they said only my husband and I could get breakfast for the extra days which seemed odd. The breakfast buffet was excellent but expensive. Kids were cheaper if they were under 12. The drinks at the pool side were also extremely expensive. The hotel is obvously marketed extensively internationally was very crowded with Europeans and Americans as well as two wedding parties. It was nearly impossible to get a chair or lounge poolside. I never saw anyone cleaning any of the pools and they were quite dirty. I do not recommend the spa. I hurt my neck at the water slide and booked a massage. The paperwork is extensive and it took over 15 minutes to fill in which cut into my massage time so I only got 20 minutes with a very chit chatty woman. Not relaxing at all. The hotel knew we had three children, but we had to ask three times for a cot. The rooms are small, but sufficient.

Having booked a package on-line, we checked in to our West Tower room mid-afternoon.  There were several people ahead of us in line, so check-in did take a few minutes, but the desk clerk (whose name we have lost...) was friendly and efficient and said hello to us every time we passed the desk for the next 48 hours.\n\nOur room faced the pools and was large, clean, and comfortable.  It appeared to have been recently re-decorated:  new-looking drapes, carpet, and darkwood furniture.  There were plenty of lamps and a comfy easy chair.  The vanity area was large, with new granite-look laminate countertop and slate floor, which extended into the small but beautiful bathroom. (Popcorn ceilings were the only remnant of the '80's...)  There were TWO closets, and our robes and pool towels were laid out on the bed.  There was also a mini-fridge, which appeared to have been an afterthought, just sitting on the floor next to the armoire (but we did appreciate having it...).\n\nOver the next two days, we took advantage of each pool but the family one.  Indoors are a very hot soaking tub and a less-hot swimming pool.  (It was noisy and steamy in there--lots of kids!)  Outdoors are two 85-degree pools, one for adults only and one for families.  Finally there is the \""lap pool,\"" which is probably around 70 degrees, four feet deep, and long enough to, yes, swim laps.  The 85-degree pools are nestled among trees and rockeries and red cedar walkways--quite appealing.\n\nFor our first-night meal, we just had snacks and drinks in The Islands Bar.  It is a wonderfully comfortable area just off the lobby, and we had terrific service--and a Sasquatch story--from Janey and Adrian.  Try the salmon cakes!\n\nOur package included breakfasts in the Lakeside Cafe on the second floor of the east tower.  This was buffet-style and was just a step above the usual hotel breakfast room.  The difference is table-service for coffee, and an omelet station with a very long line.  The rest of the buffet was the usual:  scrambled eggs, potatoes, breakfast meats, fruits, pastries, cereals.  The selections were the same both mornings.\n\nOn the second night we had our dinner in the Copper Room.  We enjoyed looking at the historical pictures in the hallway on our way there, and felt like we'd stepped back in time--into a real \""supper club\"" like we'd seen in movies from the '40's.  Tables were arranged around a large dance floor and live music was provided by the Jones Boys (Jones Brothers?). Their music was NOT from the '40's--it was OUR music, from the '60's, and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  Everything from Elvis to the Eagles.  The food was good, but not anything special, and we were glad that it was included in our package deal because it could have been a very expensive meal.\n\nThere are places where this resort is showing some wear-and-tear; there were some end-of-season cleaning jobs that needed doing.  But the public areas were generally sparkling.  We loved the old copper grand piano in the lobby!  Despite being under evergreen trees, the outdoor pools were very clean.  The family pool was actually shut down for a couple hours one afternoon, while it was meticulously vacuumed and skimmed.  And the staff was not only professional, but friendly.  The only exception to this was the hostesses at the breakfast buffet, who seemed near-surly as they seated us each morning.\n\nWe also wonder why the charge for wi-fi?  We just left our computer in the bag and probably had a better \""away from it all\"" experience that way, but business people can't always do that.\n\nThere is plenty to do here besides soak in the pools--as long as the weather is nice.  We rented a paddle boat on the lake.  There are also several other dining options in town--better suited to families than the Copper Room.  We look forward to going back and enjoying it all again.",4,positive

We usually meet here as family comes up from Vancouver and we park at this resort because of the location.  We usually try to get a package special to save on costs.  Also if you have BCAA you get a 10% discount which is not well advertised. \n\nSome things about this hotel to know are:\n\nThe main hotel is the oldest section, no air conditioning and can be very warm if the weather is warm.  Fans are supplied however when no breeze to cool down the room the fans blow around warm air!  This place needs to be upgraded as the carpets are wearing and old, the rooms vary and the beds vary and you never know till you get to the hotel what bed you will get in the rooms for the Main hotel.  The advertisement for the main hotel will say double bed but you might have a King bed.  This was the case with my son when we reserved fro the Aug long weekend.  He had a King bed which was a bonus but not something you find out till you arrive.  Perhaps the King bed and flat screen TV are the bonus to take away from noticing all the things that do need upgrading, ie furniture, carpet, bathrooms etc.  It is well past its prime and certainly time for the owners to put the money back into a renovation.   Most people dont mind paying for clean, upgraded rooms.     \n\nWe dropped down again this past w\u002Fe to meet up with family and we were again in the main hotel as  frankly I don't like to pay 300\u002Fnight  when I dont even do that for Hawaii!  The rooms are advertised as non-smoking however our room just stunk of stale cigarette smoke and the windows were left closed.  I called the front desk but they did not have another room with a King bed that we could get into until much later.  They offered to come and have housekeeping spray the room to \""freshen\"" it up however I declined as not sure what the chemical was given we had to be out of the room for an hour following.  We opened the windows and put the fans on to air it out.  Unfortunately this smell was imbedded in the furniture and linen.  Very sad.  The couch in the room was ripped and very unappealing to the eye.  Again this is the old section however we are still paying 200\u002Fnight and should for that money have furniture that is not ripped and worn.  The bed was clean and comfortable. \n\nThe lake view is nice however if the weather is nice and the nights are warm partiers will linger on the public beach and party and that can go on well into the wee hours of the morning.  With windows open to cool the room this can be very annoying if one who is a light sleeper. \n\nEach room does have a little bar fridge and little coffee maker with coffee supplied.  The coffee shop in the entrance is great as well.  The breakfast bars they sell are great little snack.  Some staff there are friendlier than others!  \n\nThe pools are fun as there is an outside cool lap pool which is where most of us will go and lounge about when the weather permits.  Unfortunately toddlers with diapers share this pool as well.  It would be awesome to have a total adult pool with no toddlers.  There is a hot pool for adults as well as the family pool where all the little kids are.  Inside there is another lukewarm pool as well as the very hot pool.  It is disappointing to see toddlers with diapers in that pool as well.  It is too hot for them and diapers are just unhealthy and a turn off for those of us that like to relax away from the toddlers. There is a little water park for the kids to play in and a nice big garden area to walk around or drag your lounge chair over to get away from the crowd. We did not use any of the Spa facilities. \n\nWe usually go down the street for our breakfasts.  They are much more affordable and the ambiance out on the patio's on the street are nice sitting across from the lake.  We have done the Copper Room a couple of times in our stays and the food has been good.  It is pricey partly due the cost of the band which is imbedded in the food prices.  The band is entertaining and brings people out on the dance floor which is fun to watch.  \n\nThis past weekend we had Joseph as our waiter in the Copper Room and he was very accommodating with all our many requests and questions about the menu.  \n\nIt is great area to go for a hike around the area and also to go for the walks around the lake.  Harrison Lake is beautiful and the beach fills up pretty fast with the locals coming in the early am to claim their spot for the day.  It gets very busy.\n\nThere are many little shops down the street and again when the weather permits the ice cream shops, coffee and chocolate shops are busy with all of us coming down for treats.  Many european tourists are visiting to take in the ambiance of this very picturesque area. \n\nWe did have a lunch in the Lakeside cafe out on the patio however the service was extremely slow and that was not due to it being busy.  \n\nThis resort is a great wedding venue and having been there many times there is always a wedding.  This past weekend there were 3 and it is fun to see brides and guests milling around.  \n\nAll in all this place is what you make it.  Going into this placing knowing some of the quirks helps make the stay easier...ie the weird bed issue that cannot be guaranteed till at the hotel unless staying in the East or West Wings.  Just a note that one of the toll free call centers is in California.  These agents have no clue about the hotel and you can ask them to connect you to the hotel directly.  It is worth speaking to an agent who knows the hotel and area.  \n\nFor the most part we do not spend much time in the room itself but rather outside in the pools or hiking around the lake and mountain trails.  We will not be disappointed to find out it is going through a renovation in the Main Hotel.  It is no longer \""back in the day\"" and time for AC, clean carpets and remove the old smells that have never left from \""back in the day\"".",3,negative

It was tiny - so small there was only a side table on one side of the (double!) bed because there wasn't enough room on the other side.  The shower head was too low and nothing drained or flushed properly.  The room also smelled badly, although I left the window (which faced a wall) open and by the time I got back from soaking in the springs it was tolerable.  But for $200 a night in the off season?  No thanks!\n\nThe pillows were also awful.

The east side of the tower is facing beautiful  distant view of mountains with open sky, as well as view of the lake and the village, whereas the west side of the tower is facing very close view of the mountain with little sky and some lake, instead of the village you have pleasure of seeing only roofs of hotel buildings with a lot of industrial noise, likely from the hotel laundry. Nevertheless, rooms on both sides are advertised as facing the village, which is incorrect and misleading, and the room rate for both sides is the same, which is very unfair. In effect you would not even want to be on the balcony if you get a west side room. The buffet served in cafe is very mediocre and highly overpriced, and you will not be allowed into the copper room restaurant unless you are formally dressed.

The lake and surrounding area is beautiful, the pools are very commercial and you wouldn't really know they were anything other than regular pools heated to varying temperatures, but they're wonderful and relaxing just the same (although it never ceases to amaze me they have no markings in the one pool that you can actually swim any lengths in so be very careful you don't scrape the bottom or sides of the pool). Everything is overpriced but if you can subscribe to their email distribution list\u002Fnewsletter and get in on the periodic bed and breakfast specials then the value for your money isn't too bad as long as you're not expecting any sort of natural hot springs environment. The cabins are pretty outdated, I would recommend a room in the west\u002Fnewer wing with a small balcony overlooking the lake.

Indoor hot springs feature a very hot pool and a separate cooler, mineralized pool. Nice looking stone decor. Relaxing atmosphere--except when screaming children and their parents ignore the no jumping, no diving signs until 10pm, when all pools become adult only. Cons: rooms in the main hotel are dated and cramped, more motel than hotel, with saggy beds and small bathrooms. Food is always an issue here, room service options unappetizing and boring.

You got the impression that each portion of food was precisely weighed. We decided to give her a decent tip, but we used our calculator to compute it precisely to the penny. It just seemed appropriate.\n\nThe facility is modern and clean. That is good. You could almost call it sterile. There seemed to be plenty of workers who were doing their best to avoid the people and clean up after them. They were at their best in this role. This would be a great property if not for all the people.\n\nI was really looking forward to sitting in the warmest outdoor pool in the early morning when it was quiet. Sadly, this is against the rules. I got kicked out of the pool, and told I needed to wait a few minutes until 8am. There are lots of clocks around, so no excuse for getting in the pool a few minutes too early.\n\nWe thought the cost of the room was reasonable. But dinner was extremely expensive. They charged us $100 to allow our dog to sleep in the room, which was more than the cost per person. And the dog didn't need a towel.\n\nI don't know whether we will come back here. We might, because of the good location. But you certainly won't confuse this with Pagosa Springs. We will keep looking for a better place.",3,negative

We were VERY DISAPPOINTED with the value of this hotel. \n\nAs many other reviewers have mentioned, the quality of this hotel vs its costs are out of line. It's 4-5 star prices for a barely 3 star hotel. \n\nWe booked a room in the East Tower. If you don't want to rent a paper-thin walled, nearly century-old room, book the newer East Tower. Our spacious room had a beautiful view, with a small private balcony. The positives end there. The room was appointed with rather old furniture, a king sized bed that was at the end of its life span (sagged at each side and far too soft), a pull out couch, chair and small table. The hotel offered free WiFi, but the signal was quite weak in our suite. \n\nThe bathroom was very large and decent enough, although there was some garbage on the floor that we presume fell out while housekeeping was attending to the suite. (It was a bit off-putting though). The overall state if the room was sub-par for the money. We've honestly stayed in Motel 6s and Holiday Inn Expresses that blow this place out of the water, yet cost a fraction of the price. \n\nThe Copper Room Dining hall was a very pleasant experience, with a fantastic live band and dancing available. Although not really our thing, it was a nice change of pace and we enjoyed watching some of the old-timers dance. The food was fresh and tasty, well presented and on-par with this calibre of dining. Our waiter Pavel was super; friendly, accommodating and knowledgable. All of the staff in the Copper Room were simply fantastic. Kudos to that team!\n\nThe Spa \u002F Massage: oh boy, where to start? The Spa itself is very nice and the staff are friendly. However, we were greeted by our masseuses and taken out of the spa, across to an old hotel room. The brackets for the headboard were still attached to the wall, the overall appearance of the room was old and stale, the CD player that was to play relaxing spa music\u002Fsounds was malfunctioning, and the quality of the oils used were sub par. Our masseuses were not RMTs, and quite frankly, were terrible. I've honestly never had such a poor massage. My wife shares this opinion. My masseuse attempted to get the CD player up and running multiple times at the expense of the time spent attending to me. It was almost comical.  Again, for the money this was WAY overpriced. As an added insult, we were charged taxes over and above our package rate.... So don't be surprised if you receive these on your final statement. \n\nThe overall layout of this hotel is rather lacking, but one can understand and forgive this as its an old hotel that's had renovations and a major addition added-on. That being said, trucking from the pools on the far west side of the property, across the lobby \u002F main areas of the hotel up to your room on the East side in your robe, dripping wet is a little ghetto. The robes? Like tissue paper. Slippers or flip-flops provided? Nope. (Let's remember its the small touches that set resort spas apart). Paying for parking that's located close to one kilometer from the front desk? Adding more insult to injury. \n\nIn total, we spent over $700.00 for one night's stay (a couple's package). For this amount of money, we'd expect a far superior experience. This is based on similar previous experiences elsewhere, we're not just pulling numbers out of thin air here. \n\nWe submitted a survey and the manager did contact us promptly. However, there wasn't much offered in the way of apologies or an attempt to lure us back. Perhaps her hands are tied, but again, not the finest customer experience. \n\nThe location is beautiful, the Hotel itself has some charm to it, but at these prices, it simply isn't worth it. This could have become our monthly retreat.. they may have created repeat clientele and we would bring other couples.... but sadly, NEVER AGAIN.",2,negative

The adult only pool is only several steps away from the unbelievably loud family pool where the children are encouraged to scream and run around like wild animals. You can most certainly hear and see all of this from the adults only pool. Furthermore, you still get the occasional adults who try to sneak their pre-teenage children into the adult only pool defeating the whole purpose of having an adult only pool. Once in a while someone from management will come by and ask the parents to remove their children from the adult only pool but even this is rare.

This is a lovely place to create family memories that will stay with us always. \n\nYes, the hotel could be more luxurious - we've stayed in every part of the hotel, including the original main part of the hotel (very old fashioned, kinda musty smelling, can be noisy but with some interesting 2 room set-ups), a cottage (so long ago I don't really remember it), the west wing (affordable and convenient to the pools but not the nicest), the west tower (meh, it's a hotel room but the ground floor walk-outs to the pool area are very convenient albeit noisy), and the east tower (newest part by the meeting rooms and Lakeside Grill restaurant) - but it's a solid 3.5 star facility. The beds in the east tower were quite comfortable and our lakeview room was quiet, perhaps because it's before the season starts. \n\nThey do seem to skimp now on the quality of the towels and bathrobes. The waffle weave bathrobes are the thinnest I've ever seen anywhere! And if you're fussy about soap and hair products, I'd suggest you bring your own. They have a complimentary tea and cookie half-hour from 4-4:30 pm every day - get there early if you want to find a spot to sit down as everyone pours in from the pools to get their freebie. \n\nThe Copper Room has ok food and an ok band but it's always charming to see all the people there celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary or 75th birthday. They have a nice dance floor although unfortunately no longer allow children on it. The Lakeside Grill is just ok as well although the view is lovely. The German restaurant just down the street has much better food.\n\nThe reason to come here is indisputably the mineral pools. Even in the cold and rain, the pools are blissful. They have a big, shallow outdoor family pool, an adults-only outdoor pool and an outdoor lap pool which is much cooler than the others although still warmer than your typical pool. There's another very warm indoor pool and a big hot tub that fills right up in the evenings. Even though we were there in shoulder season (after Spring break, after the Easter long weekend, so presumably a very slow time), the hot tub was packed on Saturday evening. Friday evening was much quieter so it seems like a lot of people check in just for an overnight. \n\nWe also really enjoy the spa. At the risk of not being able to ever get another appointment, Yolanda does fabulous shiastsu massages and I always try to get one each time we come.\n\nI wouldn't recommend coming here if you're looking for a luxurious romantic getaway.

But the spectacular lake view is marred by a large inflated floating amusement park (see my photo). It was closed when we were there, so it's only purpose seemed to be to ruin the view. I would have really been PO'd if I had paid extra for a lake view. Otherwise everything was great. The gardens in back are very pleasant and attractive, there is a short trail through the woods to the spring source which is a nice walk, and the adjacent village has some nice shops and a good Japanese restaurant (Kitami).

We just returned home from our most-recent stay (four nights, early-September), and as done last year in July, this trip and its stay was planned and designed as a birthday treat for our daughter.\u2028\u2028\n\nThis was a return to another 'shoulder season' stay for us -- our last trip and stay was in March of this year -- we enjoy these much 'quieter', and less hectic times of the year.  Plus, rates at the Resort are less-expensive as well, and like we did for our March stay, we opted for the Senior's Getaway Package (which included breakfast in the Lakeside Cafe each morning, and one dinner - we chose the Friday Italian night buffet in the Lakeside Cafe for the dinner this time, instead of dinner in the Copper Room, our usual venue for the dinner included in the Getaway Package).\u2028\n\nOver the years, we have stayed in rooms located just about 'everywhere' within the property.  Like our last two stays, we chose a room in the West Tower, with a view to the inner courtyard, pools, and that wonderful backdrop of mountains and trees, and as before, enjoyed our set up and the great view (from our upper floor room).  With sunshine on our balcony for the late-morning and afternoon, and those views, the balcony was a favourite spot of ours to soak in the sights & sounds when we were not outside soaking in the pools themselves!!\u2028\n\nWith frequent 'trips' from our room to the various hot spring pools (for us, it was mostly to the outside adult pool), various walks into and throughout the village, along the Lake, throughout the grounds, and via the forest trails at back, we did great for lots of fresh air and exercise!!  And with all the food enjoyed between those activities, we needed that exercise!!\n\nThe grounds at the Resort were immaculate, lush, and green, and this after such a warm and dry summer.  And very colourful as well, with the many different varieties of flowering plants planted throughout the various gardens.\n\nThe Harrison Hot Springs Resort & Spa continues to hold a very warm charm for us.  It's showing its age in spots, but always manages to keep and retain its beauty.  When 'renovations' are made there, they do not stand out -- the overall look and nature of the resort, grounds, and all, are always carefully maintained.  The Resort just seems to stay the same, year after year, and that's what we so appreciate, and why we return as often as we do.\n\nWe much-enjoyed our recent trip to Harrison, and stay at the Harrison Hot Springs Resort & Spa, and look forward to doing it again some time soon.",4,positive

It has been updated in some ways and its under new management.  \nThe quality of the rooms vary by what you pay and you get better rooms if you pay more.  Some reviews complain about the tiny rooms and old style, but if you pay the lowest price you get the basic room and no A\u002FC.  We stayed in the east tower and loved it.  The room had a view of the lake and the room was plenty big.  The housekeeper brought up plenty of towels every day so we had extra for the pools.  A huge downside of this hotel is that they dont give you towels at the pool. They make you bring them from the room and if you visit the pools multiple times a day, that is a lot of wet towels.  Thankfully our housekeeper gave us extras, but other people told me their housekeeper did not do the same.  \nThe room service food was not great and it's overpriced, as is everything in Harrison Hot Springs.   I recommend eating elsewhere.  \nAll the staff at the resort were really friendly and helpful.  \nThe pools are nice, but I wish they didnt chlorinate them.  I like the outdoor family pool, but I wish it was a tad warmer than it is.  It's not hot enough to be in at night.  \nI highy recommend getting breakfast included with your room.  It's a nice breakfast and it will fill you up.  \nWe stayed here 4 nights.  The bed was uncomfortable though.  It made my back hurt a lot.  That being said I think we will come back.  It was nice and relaxing to stay here and I loved being able ot go to the pools all the time and swim in warm water with my family.  \nAnother huge drawback to this hotel is that they dont provide microwaves in the room.  That would be a nice bonus if they did.  However they do provide a very small mini fridge to keep drinks and small foods cold.  \nOne more thing is the floating waterpark is really meant for ages 9 and up.  So, I dont recommend getting that package unless you have older kids.",4,positive

We were delighted that they had roped off a section of the parking in front of the hotel for our vintage Alfa Romeo cars.  Unfortunately a big Japanese sedan had chosen to park right in the middle of the designated area, obviously unaware of the \""do not park here\"" signs.  The weather began to build as we checked in, and we had to quickly put the tops up on the spiders (convertibles).  \nOur room was adequate with a beautiful view out over the expansive lake.  We were anxious for a dip in the pool(s) before the weather turned too dismal, and yet had to wait quite a while for the designated pool robes to arrive.\nThe outside pool was quite crowded, so after a quick dip we retired to the indoor pool, which was even more crowded.  Guess the rain was sending everyone in for cover.\nLater we met with the group for a dinner in the Copper Room.  They were very accommodating for a large group (there were about 20 of us) and also the delay in our reservation due to half of the group arriving later than planned.  (Will rate Copper Room in separate review).\nRooms were okay.  Our bed was VERY hard and yet upon asking others, it appeared many others felt theirs were fine.  Perhaps our room was on the list for an upgrade.  \nBathroom was small and amenities limited.  I suppose they figure most people take more advantage of the spa onsite and aren't in their rooms as long due to our inclement weather.\nHotel is old and the add-ons over the years makes it appear confusing and yet the setting couldn't be prettier.\nOverall somewhat disappointed after years of waiting to visit Harrison.

As this was my first stay at the Resort I was looking forward to a wonderful weekend.  That was until we opened the door to our room.  I wouldn't call us high maintenance but I don't think a clean room is asking for much.  The carpet was so stained I wouldn't take my shoes off.  We appreciate history - but this facility is lost between somewhere.  Nothing seems to match.  \n\nOne of the elevators was down the entire weekend which left many waiting - many times more than the elevator could hold which meant another trip and more waiting.  Much of the time we took the stairs to the fifth floor because it took less time.\n\nPrior to going to the hot spring pools we took a walk to where the Springs are pumped (which when facing the Resort is to the right down the pathway) there was visible leaves (not a problem) but the garbage left us shocked.  Neither of us went in the pools the entire weekend.  It appears that we didn't miss anything - many said there was lots of hair among other things in the pools.  OMG.\n\nSadly The Copper Room was also disappointing.  Our food was over cooked and the selection was minimal.  Would not recommend.\n\nLast but not least we were hoping that our breakfast experience on our last day in the Lake Side Caf\u00E9 would make up for everything we experienced.  It didn't.  Take a look at the carpets, chairs, walls, ledges - all are dirty.  The yellow garbage can in the clearing section behind the screen was so filthy - I wouldn't have even allowed it in my kitchen.  It makes me wonder about their food handling abilities.  Who is running this facility?  This team obviously has no pride - if they did their staff would too.  \n\nWe tried to share our experience at the front desk and we were told there was nothing they could do but our comments would be \""passed on\"".

(We had this previously and liked it). \n Well, this time\u2026.The curtains were stained, the carpet was stained (not just a little), there was piece missing from the toilet seat, the side of the mattress with the stapes was sticking straight out.  There was no soap, and no bathrobes.  No big deal on the bathrobes, but add it all together and it is a horrible presentation.\n\nI was ready to leave. I did not want to stay there.  I was afraid to sleep in the bed.  (the bed turned out to be ok, but when you look at the condition of the room, there were serious doubts)\n \n My husband spoke the manager about our concerns regarding the room.  We were told he would look into it. ( See that is what a\"" good\"" manager does after all,  listen to people.   After all, most people just want to get things off their chest, and then they feel better, right)?\nNo action was taken by management.  \n\n Second night, the neighbors (adjoining room to ours) decided that they could party and it didn't matter what time it was.  I went to the desk and asked them if their walls were paper thin, or my neighbors were just loud.  I was told both.\nI pointed out that at 11:30 p.m., I was entitled to sleep and not listen to the entire conversation of our neighbors,  Someone did knock on my neighbors door, and they did quieten down.  For about 2 minutes.  After the second knock on their door, they finally must have gone to bed.  \n\nThe morning of our check out, we spoke the manager on duty.  We told him about our experience regarding our stay.  (The condition of the room and the loudness of the neighbors).  We had also told the manager that we had spoken a different manager our first night.\n\n I told him that while we recognize that everyone is at the resort for different reasons, party, relaxation, family, etc, (and they would have no knowledge of that when booking people in),  we paid a lot of money to stay in this resort, and the condition of the room was appalling.  And the neighbors were just icing on the cake.\n\n We should also be entitled to a reasonably nice, no scratch that, a decent room at the price we were paying.\n\n  I did not expect that this resort would present itself in this way. \n\n I told the manager that I have NO intention of coming back.  He gave his listening ear..was sorry about everything, and then told my husband and myself that he would give us a free voucher for a one night stay.  I told him, that was nice, but after this experience I have ZERO desire to stay here again.  \n\nHe said, he would give us the one night and that it would not have an expiry date.

In all fairness, the hotel rooms DO have a coffee maker....so it's holds you -- sort of.\n\nAnd then, there's the same issue with breakfast--7a.m.  I guess Canadian's don't eat brekkie at 6 a.m.??? ;-).  \n\nThis is an old hotel that has been carefully taken care of and updated.  It does have excellent and fast wifi.  It has a 20 foot sturgeon (fish) in the lobby....huge sucker.  And the decor is almost 1950's-ish, but pretty and elegant and grande.  \n\nI liked the long hall type lobby with lots of comfortable chairs to sit in and watch people go by or read or do your electronic tablet stuff.  There's a roaring fire place at one end with a semi-circle of couches and chairs around it--the most popular place in the lobby, of course.\n\nWhen we visited in mid-November, it was raining cats and dogs, gray and generally cold.  The check-in says 4pm and believe me if you come early....most likely your room won't be ready until 4pm.  Seems the management has one maid per floor--which is outrageous.  At any other upscale hotel, trust me, if you come in early, they but their butts to get you into a room as fast as possible.  Here at this one...not so much. \n\nThere's several shops in the hotel which are nice to peruse.   The Lake Side Cafe was hurting for staff and things were slow to be served.  Some food arrived hot and one person's stead was bloody and had to be sent back because she requested medium rare,not rare.  It was taken care of, of course.  The food is excellent and there's plenty of it.  We were there for dinner as well as breakfast.  I must say that their buffet breakfast was excellent.  No complaints at all.  And their omelet station was terrific.  But it opens at 7 a.m.  Not for early birds like us.\n\nThe Healing Hands Spa, hands down (pardon the pun) is a real jewel in this restort.  I know they have hot springs, but let me digress to the spa.  If you are in need of an excellent massage of any type, hot stones, etc., this should be the first place you go.  I was like melted butter oozing off the massage table when I was done.  \n\nThe hot springs ARE glorious.  They have several huge outdoor pools.  One for adults only, thank goodness, another for adults\u002Fchildren.  The indoor has a huge, rectangular pool that is up to 8 feet deep to four feet deep.  It is mildly warm. But the small, round pool nearby is probably 102F and delicious for about ten minutes.  They have al ocker room but geeze--no locks on the lockers.  Where are you to put your hotel key?  Any credit cards or your iPhone?????  This hotel really botched that thinking process.  They have bathrobes in every room, but you need a swim suit.  And I'd advise bringing floppies to wear on your feet.  \n\nI loved the Healing Hands Spa....it's top drawer, a \""10\"" in my world.  And I loved the hot springs themselves...another \""10\"" but the thoughtfulness of putting a lock on a locker so we could put our personal belongings in them and not worry that they will be stolen...its utterly illogical.  Who is running this hotel!!!????\n\nIf you don't mind going to breakfast or dinner at 7:00 am, you'll be a happy clam.  There's also a lot of nice places around this resort to go too and veg out and relax.  If you happen to be driving in this area, a stay is recommended.",4,positive

Yes, the hotel is old, with quirky corridors here and there.  But  that is the charm of this resort, it has a feel of days gone by, a slower pace, tea time in the afternoon, guests walking around in their white robes back and forth from the springs.  \nThe Copper Room dining room is an experience, elegant old fashioned feel with a solid menu of choices.  Delicious wild salmon with chardonney leek sauce this time.  It has a dance floor and The Jones Boys.  They are excellent musicians and singers with a wide repetoire from 40's to current, all very dance-able, very important for us.  Where else can you get to swing, salsa, tango, waltz, and also dance to Stevie Wonder - all while enjoying a delicious meal in nice surroundings???  You chat, dance a little, eat at little, take your time.\nThe rooms have comfy beds, huge tv, frig and coffeemaker.  This time we were in the East Tower:  newest, great lake views, super nice (probably most expensive).

There were strips of shredded fabric hanging from the mattress and stuck out from the covers and the bottom sheet on the beds was not fitted, thus in the middle of the night you find your skin lying on the mattress pad, or on one night the mattress itself as the pad slipped off the mattress - which is not at all sanitary and we were quite appalled.  We sleep on a firm bed at home. The bed in our room was rock hard and very uncomfortable, not the quality I expect at a resort.  The shelf in the fridge fell out onto my foot when I opened the door for the first time and the fridge door kept coming open on its own.  In the bathroom the fan switch was taped up with duct tape, peeling off with age, and the fan did not work well.  There were not enough bath towels in the room (we had booked four people into the room so the hotel was aware of how many were required). The check in clerk had advised us on check in there may not be enough pool towels or spa robes and to call down to get more. These came right away on the day of check in. The second day of our stay the room had still not been made up at 3:30. We called for spa towels again but after waiting a long time went to the hot springs without them.  When we returned to the room in early evening it had been made up and the towels had arrived. It would have been nice to have been in a room that had been serviced earlier in the day (all that was needed were new towels and beds made) as we spent time in the afternoon sitting in the room. The only redeeming thing about this room was the lake view, which was absolutely spectacular.  Albeit beautiful it did not justify the price we paid for the room. Now for the positive.  This resort sports it's own private hot springs, for use by hotel guest. They are lovely. There is ample room to soak in the pools and not be bumping into fellow blathers. Another plus is that there is an adults only pool, allowing those who want a bit more tranquility the ability to bathe away from the kids. If a person has any kind of mobility issues there are rooms that open right onto the pool area, thus allowing a short, mostly flat walk to the pools. The washrooms in the pool area were very clean. There are no towels at the pool area so you need to ensure you bring them from the room.  The location of the resort is right on the lake beach. There is a tennis court and great beach and hiking trail access just outside the door, which was very nice. Also, Harrison Hot Springs is a very small place. From the resort you have a quick walk and easy access to restaurants and little shops.  On the first morning there we partook in the resorts brunch which was average price and decor but had very friendly staff and good food with nice selection.  The omelettes served at the omelette station were made to order and outstanding - made by a fellow who was very personable and entertaining.  I must say that all of the staff that we interacted with were very professional and friendly.  I would like to return to this resort because, when out of the room we had a lot if fun, but don't think I can justify the cost as we were very disappointed with the quality of the room. I travel a great deal and never begrudge paying for quality but sadly do not feel we received this in our assigned room.",3,negative

We came here 20 years ago, when the hotel was really showing it's age. The new management and remodeling made a tremendous impact on us, and with the addition of the spa, it now rivals other mountain spa resorts. Can't believe the same band is still around, given a couple of new members, and the dining hall is very well maintained. Dinner was excellent, given it was a Valentine dinner set menu. The addition of the hotpools in open air is a big plus, which we really enjoyed under the chilly misty night. We no longer smell the sulfer odor of the hotsprings too.\nWe always stayed in the main hotel, which is older, but we did notice an improvement overall ( bathroom upgraded ), and yet we did see the wear & tear beginning to take on ( wall paper ). Our room was warm and bed very comfy, we had the pools view from second floor. The hotel rate for the main hotel is a bit high but I figure the hotpools makes up for it, and there is no surcharge using the resort pools. The East & West Wing hotel rooms cost more. Grounds were clean and well organized. Our best part of the day, was the couples massage. Lovely weekend considering it was wet & rainy. We'll definitly go back soon.",4,positive

We chose this to take our lab with us where large dogs are welcome free of charge.  It was clean, cozy and quaint and would book again. It had a coffee maker, and small fridge (a microwave would have been ideal). It had a small washroom with only a shower.  There was a futon couch in the front room where the kids slept and a small gas fireplace which was really nice.  There was only one TV in the main area, and only because the weather was so miserable (poured 24\u002F7 the entire time) a TV in the bedroom for us would have been nice. It was convenient to be able to park right outside the door.  It was a short walk by the Copper room to the outdoor hot springs.  There is a parking fee in the lot for hotel guests, and were surprised to find this also the case with the cottage parking, especially with the rate per night.  We enjoy the relaxing views of the surrounding mountains, lake and walks into the woods on the trails with our lab.  SHE loves the area.\nWe had stayed in the East tower during our last visit.  There are perks to either choice.  This resort has 5 of their own private hot springs for hotel guests, (three outside and two inside). They are great. There is ample room to soak in the pools and not feel too crowded. There were no towels at the pool area or indoor shower area so you need to ensure you bring them from the room.  Make sure you have footwear for pool area.\nWe decided that $27.95 pp over 12 for the buffet dinner was more than we wanted to pay (we had two teenage girls with us). So we ate off site both nights. We would have ate at the hotel restaurant the Sunday night but upon arrival were informed that the regular menu was not available ONLY buffet for all of spring break.  So we walked the area and ate first night at the Giggling Goat which had delicious fresh halibut.  The second night we ate at The Villa Toscana (Italian themed) restaurant. Recommend both restaurants. \nWe enjoyed the friendly staff, lobby area, lounge and 4 pm tea time that offered cookies and baked treats.

My husband and I stayed there for 2 nights during Spring Break and we wanted to bring the dog. The cottages are pet friendly without an extra fee, although they are priced higher than the normal hotel rooms. However, they want to charge $100 per stay for a pet in the normal hotel so it would be more expensive than the cottage and definitely not worth it. \n\nThe cottages are lovely. The have a nice living room area with a TV, fireplace, air con, futon, some chairs and a small desk table and a mini fridge that is perfect for wine and beer and small snacks. The bedroom has a comfy queen size bed with a fan and heater too. There is a small closet and dresser. The bathroom is pretty small but it does the job (only shower, no tub). The only con is the uncomfortable futon! If I had to sleep on it, I would have pulled the mattress off and just slept on that on the floor. You could really feel every bar under you while sitting on it. Not a huge deal if you don't need it, but I wouldn't be happy needing to be the one to sleep in the living room on it. \n\nThe cottages are located near the back of the property along the river with lots of green space and close proximity to the Miami bridges trail (great for a dog walk).

We stayed in the newest wing with full views of the lake and it was beautiful to wake up to the sunrise.  The room was large and quiet on the 8th floor.  The reason to stay here is for the hot mineral pools.  These are clean and well kept.  There are five different pools of varying temperature to choose from.  They have 'adult only' time in early morning and late evening.  For the first time I tried the spa and had a shiatsu massage service and the service was great - a bit pricey - but the therapist was good.  The copper room is a blast from the past - with formal dining, live band and 'ballroom' style dancing.  The meal was good.  The service was excellent.  The staff are friendly and accommodating.  The breakfast buffet food was average - the made to order omelette bar was my favorite and you can ask the chef to do anything including not adding too much or any oil.

In fact, he used to have an annual gig at this hotel and he told me that only one thing appeared to have changed in the ten years since he stayed there last.  (He maintains the Copper Room had a copper ceiling, which it doesn't now.)  I was surprised at the tiredness of the carpets and drapes.  In our room the latter had holes in the rubberized backing and they looked like they'd been cleaned so many times they'd lost their shape.  Wasn't impressed with the burgundy, forest green and navy colour scheme (although we also had a distinctly purple and white chair that looked somewhat out of place)  A note told us to keep the balcony sliding screen shut due to sand fleas so was glad that we were there on a slightly chilly weekend in April.. The empty bar fridge was an ugly white addition that looked out of place but I think there is a definite party crowd that come here and would want this amenity.  I thought the noisy group just beyond our room would keep us awake but mercifully the hot pools, pretty good couples message and dinner in the Copper Room all combined to quickly lull us to sleep. When I woke early (for a Sunday) and went down to the pools again at 8 a.m. there were lots who had gotten there before me, although I did get to swim in the lap pool  and use the circular hot pool alone for the first 45 minutes.  The pools are for guests of the hotel and spa only and attract an interestingly mixed crowd although the overall experience was like being at a CUPE convention before the beautiful airline people joined the union.  (Yes, I was a child attendee at those earlier conventions)  There were many children and a few teens and some young couples (especially wives late in their third trimester) but the majority of people were middle aged or older wearing full coverage swim wear and a lot of fancy tats.

Harrison Hot Springs is a true destination resort on the south end of  very long Lake Harrison -- or is it Harrison Lake? Anyway, they have the premo location. There are two towers, East and West, plus the main hotel. It costs more money but the best rooms are in the towers facing out to the lake, with the best views on the higher floors -- best are 5 and 6 -- which allows you to look over the trees. The rooms are very clean, great beds, and have all the usual amenities you would expect from a resort of this caliber.\n\nOur check in was horrible, with a large group all checking in at the same time, and it took more than 30 minutes to inch our way up to the head of the line. Also, keep in mind that they do not offer a breakfast menu in the cafe -- only an $18 breakfast buffet -- take it or leave it. The only option, if you want to leave it, and still eat in the hotel for breakfast, is to go to their little muffin\u002Fcoffee cafe and order a scone, or muffin and the like, along with your coffee. Big mistake in not offering a menu selection for those who want more than a muffin or a cup of yogurt, but don't want to splurge the money and calories on a big expensive breakfast buffet.\n\nGrounds are lovely, and the and the five hot springs pools are very popular and very busy most of the time -- they keep the water at about 98 degrees, which is very comfortable, and they also provide guests with nice robes to wear to and from the pools.",4,positive

Bad things?  well I wouldnt' recommend staying in a room that overlooks the pool unless you like lots of noise and steam.  Breakfast buffet is overrated but ordering from the menu has been consistently good.  I have not eaten in the copper room but there are a few good restaurants around town.

After reading many reviews, opinions, and looking at the hotel website we decided the \u2018newer\u2019 East wing. We booked the East Tower Superior King\u002FLake view @189.00nt. Parking is $12. for valet and $6. for self park. This hotel does not offer corporate rates for the business traveller. Check in is at 4PM. We enquired about early arrival as we planned on booking a round of golf at the resort owned course. We were told we could use the hotel facilities after 1PM and a room may be ready for guests before 4PM. I found it odd that the reservation agent was unable to transfer our call to the golf course. We had to hang up and make a separate call.  *Hotel guests receive a 15% discount at the course. \nWe did arrive early and were pleasantly surprised a room was available. Check in was quick and efficient. We were booked onto the 3rd floor. We found the valet and he accompanied us to our room with our luggage. \nWe cannot speak to the higher floor rooms but ours was stale and dated. Hardly the \u2019newer\u2019 wing as described by the reservation agent. It had the odor of dirty laundry. Right away we found 2 wine bottle corks on the floor by the balcony slider. We disposed of them. Upon further inspection, we found the room to be tidy but dirty. The carpet was sticky in areas and we found someone else\u2019s long hair in (not on) our bed. The fixtures in this room are worn. The sink basin stained. The bedding discoloured and pillows that had a musty odour. We did receive and change the bottom sheet where we found the hair. The housekeeping staff at this hotel are clearly not proud of their work or hotel and it shows. Spot checks by head of housekeeping are needed here. \nWe did not eat at the restaurant and missed afternoon tea while waiting for a new sheet from housekeeping. \nWe did use the adult outside spa pool at the hotel. A large warm 98F bath. Weather was nice, so a good experience overall. \nWalking through the hotel to get to the spa is where you really see how the resort has not aged well. A worn space with funky odours abound. \nWe would not stay here again primarily because of the housekeeping practises.

I can only imagine coming to this hotel decades ago and the old photos in the common areas  give you that feeling of nostalgia.  The Copper Room helps give you that feel you are lodging at a high end grand hotel.  The guest rooms though are sadly in need of updating, paint, and clean, unstained carpets.  You won't see any of the imagined polite and well-travelled guests from days gone by.  The hotel attracts party people and families with small children. The lobby and Lakeside Restaurant are family friendly and that can make or break a romantic interlude for two. The atmosphere in the adult pool is lovely and relaxing when there is not a large group of party guests in the evenings.  The pool could be kept cleaner.  The weekends are not the best time to stay and perhaps it is quieter on the weekdays. The hotel walls are thin in all the wings and the guests are inconsiderate coming in at the early morning hours.   The coffee shop gives a pleasant diversion and refreshment snacks to make up for the stuffy and minimal offerings of lunch at the Lakeside restaurant as well as the bar menu.  The Lakeside restaurant buffet for breakfast and dinner is acceptable without too much trimmings.

data\ca\154931\183786\209433024.html,Harrison Hot Springs Resort &amp; Spa,"""We came the last weekend of April for our first visit to the resort to relax and soak in the hot springs.  The resort is wholly centered on the hot springs, which are amazing and worth a visit on their own merits, but I also feel the resort could try to take more advantage of the adjacent Harrison Lake.  Also take note that the hotel was built in 3 phases over the past 75 years or so, so some sections of the hotel are more modern than others.\n\nHOT SPRINGS: The hot springs in the hotel are amazing.  There are five man made pools, three of which are outdoors and two indoors.  Unlike many hot springs, there's no foul odor.  The biggest pool is outdoors, irregularly shaped and about 3-4 feet deep with multiple entry points, including a level entry point perfect for little children.  We spent the majority of our time in this pool as the temperature very comfortable even when it got cold at night.  This pool is where most of the kids at the hotel spent their time and had a blast.  There are benches around the edge of pool where you can just sit and soak as long as you like.  At night, sitting in this pool (or the adults-only pool), under the trees looking up at the stars and timbered hillside was absolutely magical.  The adults only pool is almost identical to the main pool, only slightly smaller and slightly warmer.  The third outdoor pool is rectangular and though warmed by the hot springs, was certainly the coolest of them all.  It was deeper and long enough to swim short laps if not too full of people.  The two indoor pools are in a separate building from the hotel, so you still have to go outside to get to them.  The bigger of the two pools is kidney shaped and the deepest, about 9-10 feet and had an average temperature.  The final pool is the one pictured above.  Circular and about 20 feet in diameter, this pool was the hottest of the bunch, coming with warnings not to stay in for more than 10 minutes.  This pool can only seat around a dozen people, but as hot as it is, people generally rotate out of the pool quickly.  The walls have wonderful relaxing cascades of water and there are wooden bins around it for you to put your towels, shirts, sandals, etc.  The indoor facility also contains sauna rooms and restrooms so you don't have to run all the way back to your hotel room.  \n\nThe ROOM: We ended up staying in oldest section of the hotel and our room had all of the things you'd expect in a standard hotel room.  Our room had its own radiant heater that we could adjust to our preferences.  The bathroom was awkward with the door opening right between your legs if you were sitting on the toilet, but otherwise was adequate.  It was clean with updated carpets and comfortable beds.  Our overall feeling was that the room was sufficient, but nothing special.  The two other sections of the hotel were built later in the 20th century, so I assume those rooms would be nicer, though perhaps pricier too.\n\nThe RESTAURANTS: The were two main restaurants and a coffee stand in the hotel.  As we had a small child, we declined to eat at the ballroom in the evening and instead ate in town, though it appeared there was live music, a high-quality menu and large dancefloor if you want a fancy evening.  For breakfast, however, there is a wonderful buffet breakfast on the second floor overlooking the lake.  For a modest charge, you get all-you-can-eat access to an omelet bar where a cook mixes your chosen ingredients into an omelet, fresh fruit, juices, cereals, a selection of breads and a toaster, and a good basic selection of breakfast foods in warming trays including bacon, sausage, eggs, hash browns, hard-boiled eggs, etc.  Don't skip the hazelnuts, they are fresh grown in the nearby Fraser valley and are fantastic.  The servers were very friendly and attentive, even offering to get more juice for us when we began to run out so we didn't have to go back to the buffet.  There is also a coffee stand at the entrance of the hotel which serves espresso drinks for those in need of a post-relaxation boost.\n\nSome random notes: \n- The hotels towels are pretty basic.  Though we had plenty for the weekend, the towels are a little small for larger visitors, so you may want to bring your own beach towels to help keep you warm outside, especially at night, when going to and from the pools.  \n- Part of the hotel is a convention center, so you may encounter a convention, wedding, reunion while at the hotel.  \n- There is a \""Game Room' in the hotel, but the games haven't been updated in several decades (one of them is Toobin' and the screen is so bad you can't even see anything on it anymore) and should be eliminated or updated.  There is free Wi-Fi in the hotel now too, so most kids will probably just play on their phones whenever they aren't in the pools.\n- There are gift shops with your standard souvenirs and an activities desk if you want to book a fishing adventure or other trip out on the water.\n- The lobby is very plush with a large fireplace and pianos. \n- Parking is NOT free, even if you are staying at the hotel, which I do not understand.  If you're willing to walk a little, free parking can be found just outside the hotel on the city streets.\n- There is also a Spa for those looking for a massage or other treatment, but we did not use the facility so I can't comment.\n- The town is close enough to walk to nearly all of the shopping, restaurants and activities in town.",5,positive

They DID NOT clean the balcony for quite some time I believe, it was unusable because of that.  The one thing I did like was the giant stone shower that the room had, everything else was mediocre.  The noise was very loud from the room next to us that must have had like 10 kids and 10 adults in it each night.  I don't mind noise but when it was just us trying to enjoy some relaxation it was difficult with constant screaming kids. \nWe had the couples massage package,  the spa was amazing looking BUT we did not get our massage in the spa..... they took us to the old part of the hotel on the bottom floor where they had a guest room setup like a massage room....  no music.....all you could hear is screaming running children again.

Used the 2 tennis courts, one has cracks. Not used much so played for hours. 4 pm afternoon tea very popular. Tea and cookies, lemon loaf, banana and poppy seed were moist and delicious. Morning had a quiche from caf\u00E9. There is also a lounge and restaurant. Grounds are beautifully done with flowers and fountains. Highly recommend for a quiet vacation.

She thought it\u2019s safe to put a 6-month old in a single bed?). We asked to be moved to a room which did accommodate a cot, but she replied back saying that we need to do that through booking.com.

Not sure what the whole \u2018your room does not accommodate a cot\u2019 was all about.\nAside from that, the room was very dated, taken out of the 70s. The carpet was shabby, the shower curtain dirty (with water stains), there was some paper tissue behind the toilet when we got there, cups were filthy.

The warm pool is the family pool, great for lounging by the waterfall and playing with your kids. The hot pool is adults only so over 18's makes it the perfect place to relax in quiet away from the hub of activity.

There is also a steam sauna indoors in the locker room.\n\nThere are a lot of kids everywhere so it's very family friendly.  The adult pool is mostly senior citizens.\n\nThe location is great and the view of the lake is nice.\n\nI have stayed on the west tower - lake view room.  The room was a little old and dated and view was nice.  It is close to the pools although the route to get to the pools can be a little confusing with lots of turns, etc.\n\nThe east tower - lake view room is also nice.  The rooms tend to be a little larger and the rooms are renovated.  However, the walk to the pool area is a little further as you need to cross the lobby to get to the other side (or walk across to the other side on the 2nd floor).\n\nBreakfast buffet is pretty good with a nice omelet bar (funny guy named Ken cooks omelets), pancakes or waffles (soggy though), sausages, cereal, toast\u002Fbagels, fruit, juices, etc.  If you can get a package that includes it, it's a good deal.\n\nThe waterpark across the street on the lake is pretty fun although a bit tiring to climb the inflatables.

data\ca\154931\183786\21803891.html,Harrison Hot Springs Resort &amp; Spa,"""I've stayed at this hotel many times -- usually once or twice each year.  This time, I stayed for an extended long weekend.  The hotel is a classic, although it is showing its age.\n\nWe stayed in the older, \""main\"" section of the hotel, which is less expensive than the newer towers. However, I'm not the type to focus on whether the bedspread or lampshades are \""dated\"". But if that's something you care about, you may be disappointed with the Harrison.\n\nParking is a reasonable $5 per night.  They have free wireless internet -- although you'll have to settle for the \""wired\"" connection in certain parts of the hotel where the signal isn't strong enough.\n\nWe had both the breakfast and dinner buffets at the Lakeside restaurant.  It was very busy, and there was quite a wait (for breakfast).  But it was worth the wait and the price was right (breakfast for two was included in the special weekend package price).\n\nThe key attraction of the hotel is the pools.  They are nothing special compared to the typical pool set-up in a five-star resort hotel.  But they are luxurious by Harrison standards.\n\nPool view rooms come at a premium (as do lake view), but I've read that if you don't want to hear the sounds of the pool (including the sounds of playing, splashing children), book something away from the pool.  The pools are open quite late.  Personally, I'd take the pool view rooms any day.  That said, our room was in the middle of the building with very little view - but the price was right.\n\nThe hotel has a \""fine-dining\"" restaurant called \""The Copper Room.\""  It includes live music (usually a swing-type jazz band) seven days a week.  While the decor isn't elaborate, it has a very classy atmosphere (dress code in effect).  We ate there one night, which was also part of the package.  The food was fancy and also very nice.\n\nParticularly in the older (main) part of the hotel, the rooms do show their age: the decor has not been updated, the bathrooms are older tile with issues you might expect of something that has not been recently updated (e.g., the screw holding the bathtub fixture together had worked its way out and I simply screwed it in with my hand).\n\nI have a couple new pet peeves - lack of hooks in the bathrooms.  Particularly for a hotel that boasts its hot spring pools, it would be nice if the bathroom had more than just the single hook on the back of the door.  Also, electrical outlets.  It used to be that four to six outlets in a room was enough.  However, with two lamps, a TV and clock radio -- it doesn't leave much room to plug in a computer, CD-player, cell-phone charger(s), etc.  We ended up unplugging the coffee-maker and a lamp so we could plug in all our hardware.\n\nAll in all, the Harrison is still a fine place.  It will have to be careful to make sure it doesn't fall into disrepair.  However, until then, I think it is still the only place to stay in Harrison and I'd be unlikely to choose to stay somewhere else.",3,negative

Interestingly, we were there about a year or so ago when new ownership was announced while we were in the Copper Room. Sadly, the changes that we noticed this year were NOT for the better. Firstly, we had paid extra for a pool side room and where told that we could not have any visitors who might use the pool without paying another 15.00 per person. We were also told we had to wear wrist bands to identify ourselves as guests. Although we were wearing the wristbands we were still asked at breakfast for a card to prove that we were entitled to a free breakfast. The wristband wasn't enough.  I finally just signed our room number on the bill, left  and then checked at the desk on the way back to our room. I was informed that there was no problem. The next morning the same thing occurred.  I also heard two ladies at another table being told to produce a card for their breakfast, apparently the communication between the desk and the cafe is not a priority. Then our sink would not drain and a plumber had to be called in. He did come quickly, but we were our of the use of our bathroom and sink for several hours and unable obviously to use the pool during that time. The sink was fixed. At the Copper Room that evening again we were asked for a card that was supposed to have been given to us when we arrived. It was supposed to be a purple card in our welcome package. I could only remember one such card and that was for the internet number. We were told that we would have to have the card before the night was over or pay for the meal. So I left my wife sitting there embarrassed and feeling like we were cheating the hotel while I went back to the room and searched for the elusive purple card. No such card found. Back to the front desk and they issued me a card - wow - now I could release my wife from captivity and have our meal. Then we noticed that the meal order had changed from last year also. You could no longer order off the full menu but only items on one side and if you wanted anything from the other side - yup another 15$ a person. This was getting a bit much. Meanwhile back in the room the toilet now has to be flushed twice to work.\n\nWell, after a wonderful trip the year before and expecting the same thing this year, it would seem all these changes have probably taken place since the new ownership took over. I was reluctant to respond when I checked out and the girl asked how our visit was, but I decided, well, perhaps I should tell her. I did not want to say everything was fine and then complain behind their back, so I told her and I must admit I expected at very least an apology, or perhaps for the manager to come personally to express an interest. But all I go was \""Have a good day!\"" admittedly, the day did get better after I left. \n\nSorry, but we will not be back again. Too bad, the previous year had been a delightful escape that we would gladly have repeated for years to come, but it isn't going to happen now. Good luck to the new ownership.",2,negative

Just 90 minutes East of Vancouver or about 3 hours from Seattle, if you cross at Sumas, WA\u002FAbbotsford, BC through the heart of pastoral farmlands.\n\nThis past week, three of us headed north for a two night stay at the Harrison Hot Springs Resort and Spa.  Included with your room, is access to five various heated mineral pools located on the resort property.  The pools are for guests only and a wristband along with your bathing suit is all you really need.  Nearly everything else is provided by the resort or available within easy walking distance.\n\nEach of the pools is unique.  There are three outdoors and two indoors.  One is set aside for adults only and the others vary in temperature depending on their purpose.  The shallow lagoon pool is warm and kid friendly.  The lap pool is kept at a cooler temperature for those looking to build up a sweat with exercise.  The indoor pools are a great break from the sun and for soaking up the steam.\n\nDuring the lunch hours a complete BBQ area is set up and for a few dollars you have your choice of beef or chicken sandwich or wrap with chips served to you poolside.  You can either walk up to order beverages or the hotel wait staff will come around and take your order.\n\nFor a resort town I was surprised at how affordable everything was and the variety that was offered.  None of the typical food and drink gouging going on that is commonly experienced in and around such focused tourist destination areas.  We tried this great little German restaurant one night that turned out to be fantastic.\n\nIt is always eye opening when meeting people from all over the world.  This is one destination we will keep going back to.  With the heated mineral pools, comfortable swim conditions exist year round.  Timing a trip up there during the winter months with snow on the ground is already on our list for next year.",5,positive

Really we have to get two rooms for my husband and I and our 17 and 18 year old kids, which sets us back over $450\u002Fnight, just to enjoy the hot pools. They don't have any family  suites unless you can stand no A\u002FC and want to be in the really old run down main HOTEL.\n\nThey act snobby and don't seem to care about loyal long term guests. so my advice spend your money elsewhere until they come back to earth on the price\u002Fvalue equation.",2,negative

There wasn't much to do with a family and kids except fun in the pool. All other activities around the resort were costly and none were inclusive on the Resort reservation. Even after swimming in the hot pools we were thirsty needed water and no water fountains around. The room had two 150 ml small bottles of water with a sign - $2 Per bottle will be charged and added to bill. That's pathetic. Pretty much we were forced to buy drinks from pool side bar. Even there were no microwaves in the lounge for guest to use overnight or after all restaurants are closed.",5,positive

Great place for families with children or couples who are looking for relaxation. The resort is on a big lake and surrounded by mountain views. We got a lake view room this time and were saddened that the beautiful view of blue lake and green mountains has been marred by a garishly green, blue, and yellow floating water park. Great fun for the kids but it needs to be moved elsewhere or the resort should deeply discount the rooms. We'll stay in a pool view room next time.  As usual we enjoyed the adult's only pool, indoor pools, and outdoor cold pool.  The usually scenic walking path to the hot springs source was dominated  by the gauche water park.  Sense of being in the mountains and surrounded by nature lost to the new monstrosity.  Hotel front desk staff and management were very nice and helpful.  The maids however did not clean the rooms very well.  We couldn't detect any signs of dusting and they didn't even make our bed.",4,positive

We could not check in until 4pm and check out was at 11am, although we could use the pools etc. for a period of time before check in and after check out.  We ended up spending the day at the public beach during the day Saturday and having a late lunch before we checked in.  We arrived at the hotel at 3:30pm, and were told that a room was not available yet and that we would have to wait.  At 4pm, we asked again if a room was available yet (we had been out in the sun all day and needed to take a cold shower and rest).  For $200\u002Fnight, I expected more.  I have stayed in $80\u002Fnight motels that were much nicer than the room we were shown.  It overlooked a roof, with a giant generator obstructing any daylight to our room.  Therefore, our room was extremely dark.  The rooms are also not air conditioned, and when the high was 30 degrees, the room ended up being sweltering hot.  That evening, as we were reading in bed, we heard a rustling outside of our window (which was open because of the heat).  My boyfriend got up to investigate and informed me that raccoons were trying to get in to our room.  The screen was broken, and their little fingers were in fact under the screen and it did not seem unreasonable to think they would be in the room shortly.  We had to sleep with the window closed, the heat was unbearable.  Also, it seemed like the hotel put us on the \""party\"" floor, as people were yelling and slamming doors until very late at night (2-3am).  Additionally, the wifi in the room was extremely spotty.  When we expressed our concerns, regarding what an awful night we had, we were told \""there is nothing we can do about the raccoons, they live here\"".  \n\nOn the positive side, the hot spring pools were very nice!  That is the only good thing about this hotel, as far as I can tell.\n\nI have heard that other rooms are much better, so maybe we just received a dud.  I was so disappointed with the service and the quality of the hotel, I will not be recommending or coming back to this place.  My boyfriend and I are both in professional school (law school and vet school respectively) and we don't have a lot of time to get away between our heavy course loads.  We take our weekend getaways very seriously, and this place left a really bad taste in my mouth.",3,negative

Our room was very clean, comfortable, and perfectly adequate, even though it was in an older wing of the building. The buffet meals were much higher quality than your average mainstream hotel buffet. And we had a fantastic dinner at the Copper Room, the hotel's formal restaurant\u002Flounge. We enjoyed the fun live music, which was a good mix of different styles. The atmosphere was classy while being friendly and comfortable, and by the end of the evening almost all the guests were on the dance floor. \n\nMy favorite part about this resort was the outdoor scenery. We went on a kayaking tour (scheduled through the office at the resort) with absolutely breathtaking views of the lake, river, forests, and wildlife. I would HIGHLY recommend it! We also enjoyed walks on the levees around the lake. And, of course, the heated pools were lovely! Even though it was slightly rainy throughout much of our stay, the pools were very comfortable and enjoyable, both outdoors and indoors. There's nothing quite like relaxing in a tropical-temperature pool while looking at a beautiful garden that fades slowly into a meadow and then into the spectacularly green evergreen forest of BC. Nothing short of magical!",4,positive

We took advantage of their senior special; two nights stay, dinner for two at the copper room and two breakfasts along with, of course, use of the hot spring pools. My experiences with \""specials\"" in the past has been mixed. This was a pleasant surprise. Our room was large, and although in the older part of the hotel was quite nice, not five star, but clean and well appointed. Our dinner in the Copper Room was very good. Service throughout was excellent and friendly. The breakfast buffet was very good with lots of variety including omelets made to order. I would advise eating breakfast early to be the rush.\n   The resort and the nearby businesses are not inexpensive as they have a cornered market , but the resort was nice with excellent hot pools which are nicely landscaped and are more than just a swimming pool with hot water.\n   If you go during the week when school is open you will have a more enjoyable time in an adult setting.",5,positive

Also no water fountain to get a cold drink of water from. The rooms I have stayed in the newer east side and the rooms are a bit nicer but further to walk to the pools.

It had a view of the flat roof, and an exhaust vent right outside the window.  The room had 2 queens and was very small. In the short time we were there, I hit my elbow on the tall dresser twice.  I called to change rooms and they were polite and accommodating, offering us Rm. 402, 1 double, 1 queen.  This rm. also over-looked the roof, but had a peek-a-boo view of the mountains, (Bear Mountain, I believe)  as well as the moon.  It was roomier too.  The furniture in both rooms could do with an upgrade. (Hence the rating)  As this was our first trip to HHS (30 yrs ago doesn't count) and we were not in the room much, it was fine.  We would spring for a lake view w\u002Fbalcony or pool walk-out room if staying longer than 2 days. (West Tower, I believe.)   The pools and gardens were fantastic and so relaxing, after 3 days of horse-backriding at Flying U Ranch in 100Mile, Canada. (Great place!) \nWe had delicious food (Sock-eye Salmon) at The Copper Room, and enjoyed the excellent cover band as well. We did the Sandy Cove \u002FWhippoorwill Pt hike and agree that the first 150 metros are the most difficult, esp. on the way back as you are climbing down steep grade over a lot of rocks in the path.  Good Hiking boots are a must.  The area is gorgeous and I wish we had more time to hike other trails. Hicks Lake trail sound's terrific.   All the staff we encountered at HHS (Bar, Front Desk, Room service, wait staff, hostess,custodian, etc) were kind and helpful.  There were a few grumpy, demanding, older patrons, which brought us amusement as to the privilege and silly demands expected by some people. The Hotel staff did well with these characters.

They need to decide what kind of resort they want to be.  Is it a spa\u002Fresort? Is it a children's playground? Is it a mountain lake get-away.  They can't be all things to all people.  I believe they are leaning toward child friendly resort.  Even though the majority of the guest where in the 50 to 60 something age bracket.  The room was comfortable, but they need to add more rooms with king beds.  I would hope they would consider making the indoor spa pools, adult only.  The soothing music can barely be heard over the playful noise of children in diapers sitting in the hottest pool.

I also booked a couples massage for the following morning.\n\nIt was the start of August and the parking lot was packed. It also costs an extra $6 to park. Our room in the main building was very tiny. Barely fit the bed and dresser. The bathroom was even smaller. 'No problem', we thought, since we'll be spending all of our time in those natural hot springs. Well, it turns out they are just pools. Regular pools. They may be a bit hotter than some, but they certainly aren't the natural, secluded springs you might picture. Also, we didn't have robes in our room and it took ~45 minutes for delivery after the initial service call was placed.\n\nAfter that disappointment, we toured around and I will admit the beach and restaurants near the hotel are ok. Back to the room and we find that it is still about 90 degrees (30+?). There is no a\u002Fc, at least not in the main building rooms, and it was too hot until ~3am.\n\nThe massage was ok, but for $300 it was not worth it. I've had massages done just as well and just as relaxing for half of that at 'luxury' hotels.\n\nOverall, I would say avoid.

The decor is very boring and tired. Each room however has a nice little patio with either a mountain or lake view. The bathrooms are large but again they are very out of date. It's not terrible by any means but the rooms seem to be stuck in the early 90's. \n\nPools - You will not be spending much time in your room! The pools are amazing and the reason that you visit this hotel.They have two indoor spa pools and three outdoor pools. The indoor large pool is like swimming in a warm bath! It's amazing and I spent most of my time in it. It was September and a wee but chilly but the outside pools were beautiful. They reminded me of being in Mexico .... Without the free liquor of course. They have chairs set up outside so you can sit or swim, it's up to you. The outdoor pools are warm and two are fed by the hot springs. The pools were very relaxing and were the highlight for me.\n\nDining - We ate breakfast at the Buffett twice. The food was pretty good. They had an omelette station and the regular breakfast offerings. The bacon was excellent :) It was very busy when we went but the service was good. Our server was an older gentleman who had worked there for over 40 years! He was very funny and truly made our day with his wise cracks. \n\nThe dinner included in our package was excellent.

We have been coming here for the past 7 years. The staff is always friendly and helpful. We have stayed in all sections of this hotel. And there are rooms for all budgets. Depending on whether you are here for the pools or to hang out in your room, you need to figure out before choosing a room. The main hotel is the oldest part of the hotel. Great if you are on a tight budget, plan on spending most of your time in the pools, quaint and charming, but doesn't have air conditioning, so can get quite warm in the summer months. The west wing is 2 levels, rooms are bigger and is quiet as it further away from the pools and main lobby. The west tower I believe is 6 stories. One side faces the lake,  the other faces the pools. When we stay here we book in advance to get a pool walkout room. There are only 6 walkout rooms, which are awesome if you plan on spending lots of time in the pools and if you have other friends staying in the hotel.(then your beverages are nice and handy) The east tower is the newest and most expensive of the sections. The rooms and views are nice. It is 8 stories high. There are lake views,  lake\u002Fvillage views and mountain views. I guess it just depends on how much you wish to pay.There is complimentary tea at 4 everyday. If you book your room through their website they always have deals from Sunday thru Thursday night. From seniors, BCAA, romance, breakfast and dinner in the Copper Room (if you feel like dancing) just breakfast and Girls getaways. It all depends on your budget,  but I would highly recommend this hotel if the hot springs are why you are coming to Harrison.  The healing spa is great as well. We usually get a couples massage. But book it at the same time you book your room, as the spa seems to always be busy.  I hope that you find this information helpful. We also enjoy going in the fall, winter and spring months, as the pools are always warm. Almost forgot they also have a few cabins as well. We have never stayed in one,  but would be great for a family and I believe that one of the might be animal friendly. We have also found that sometimes if you can't find what you want on the website, you might be able to get it if you call the hotel personally.

No A\u002FC would have been an issue a month earlier but we managed fine with the ceiling fans and upright fans.  We were traveling with a 4 year old and a 1 year old so we really liked the idea of the two separate rooms the Main Family Room offered.  The kids shared the bedroom with 2 twin beds (the 1 year old was in a portable crib we brought from home) and hubby & I took the queen.  It was so nice to be able to talk and have lights on after the kids went to bed!  The building is older, built in the 1920s, but the charm is there.  We love old historic buildings so it was great.  I loved the old wooden doors and baseboards!  The uneven floors were charming too.  The bathroom was updated, it was perfect. \n\nA few small complaints:  The fitness center doesn't open until 8am as it's over hotel rooms.  Not many plugs in the older rooms so bring a power bar if you have a lot to charge.  \n\nThe pools were wonderful.  We took water wings for the 4 year old and a life jacket for the 1 year old.  It worked out great.  We wished we had taken housecoats (aka bath robes) for the kids as the hotel only has adult sized ones.  The fire burning in the upper lobby was wonderful after getting out of the outdoor pools.   The family pool was our favorite.  \n\nThe Lakeside Cafe breakfast buffet was wonderful.  We were able to get the two adult buffets included in our BCAA package ($18 x 2 value).  The children cost $6 each but it was well worth it.  The hot options were incredible.

Over the past 10 years I have been a guest at the resort at least 35 times and have encouraged everyone to visit.\n\nThe resort used to be a place for a relaxing get away - now it is overflowing with children and entitled parents.  There is no where in the hotel that is not within ear shot of screaming children and nearly every pool is full of toys.  Parents bring their diapered babies into the adults only pool and staff does nothing to ensure a tranquil environment.  When I wrote the resort and voiced my complaints they said I should travel at off peak times. During each of my last 3 visits I have had to call the front desk because children were screaming, jumping on beds and banging on the doors. Children run throughout the hallways unsupervised - It's a gong show. \n\nQuote from HHS facebook account: \"" it can be overwhelming at times, we understand the the need for little peace and quiet, so perhaps weekday visits, during the Spring and Fall, are better.\""\n\nI also attempted to use my Entertainment Book voucher.  Even the most experienced front desk staff didn't know how to handle it (she has been checking me in for years and is super friendly and usually on top of things). The voucher was only for Harrison Hot Springs and was a discount on the posted rack rate or 10% sale rates - which ever was better). At first they refused the voucher all together saying that it didn't apply to them (it only applies to them) Then they insisted that they don't have rack rates and therefore could offer the 10%. When I pressed they went into the back room and printed off an excel sheet with prices and said that the rack rate would be the highest rate they could charge for the room (I had the reserved the highest posted rate with no discounts) which was nearly twice the rate I had booked at - so my eventual discount was a fraction of what the voucher indicated.\n\nAdd to this the terrible experience I have received in the Copper Room during Brunch (in which I could hear the staff arguing over who should take my table - eventually it was decided no one) and I'm pretty done with visiting the resort.\n\nThe Good: Beautiful Location - Great trails.\nThe Bad: Not a relaxing destination - staff disregards guests concerns.",2,negative

Lots of dust everywhere (see enclosed pic) + dirty bathroom upon arrival (long black hair on the floor and in the bathtub) so I cleaned my room myself\n. The only nice staff at this hotel is Charlotte, a tall brunette waitress at breakfast (Lakeside Cafe): she has superb people skills, is very friendly and very professional. However, the staff at the entrance who placed me at the table handed me a bill right away without a word!! So I went back to the entrance and asked her why she gave me the bill BEFORE even sitting me down for breakfast and then she explained to me (in a very tired voice) that it will be billed onto my account and then retrieved from it upon checking out (I had a B&B package). Well, it would have been nice to inform me in the first place!\n. Very old property, everywhere you look. I understand the \""heritage\"" concept but this place needs a huge make-over!\n. Upon check-in at 10 pm, the young man at the Front Desk told me that I could have a room with a lake view the next day as some pax were checking out (they were apparently \""sold out\"" on that evening... hmmmm.... really... early October???) So the next morning, around 12 noon, I came back to the Front Desk and another staff member told me that there were no rooms available so I had to keep my old dirty one overlooking the pools with non-stop screaming kids, oh joy!\n. I had a message on my phone but did not know about it as my red light was not blinking\n. Ridiculous small bottles of water in the room for... $2 + tx each!! (see enclosed pic)\n. Shameful \""comp afternoon tea\"" daily at 4 pm: that's a joke! Lots of pax to grab a Red Rose cup of tea + a miserable piece of whatever is offered on that day. Someone should explain to this hotel what an afternoon tea is all about! This one was a total joke and should be called a \""comp afternoon snack\""\n. This was supposed to be a RELAXING 2-night stay. Instead, I spent my time trying to avoid screaming kids in the pools as well as adults conversing between them or having a domestic or behaving inappropriately in the pools. Nowadays, people have no respect for anything anymore. This place is a zoo early October so I cannot even imagine how awful it must be during the summer time!!\n. People I crossed paths with were either very old or very dirty or very loud (with screaming kids) of all of that together. When I was there, an entirely Russian family was making more noise than the entire guests! Very low class.\n\nNice for:\n. The lake\n. The trail to the hot springs source\n. The gardens\n. Historic pictures throughout this tired hotel\n. The fire place in the lobby (but this place is so popular that lots of pax are there!)\n\nConclusion:\nWhat is nice is OUTSIDE of the hotel and free to enjoy! Having known in advance, I would have stayed at the Harrison Beach Hotel next door which looked way nicer. The Harrison Hot Springs resort is certainly not worth the $278.70 that I paid for a 2-night stay including breakfast. Oh! And upon arriving back home, I noticed that they retrieved $561 from my credit card instead of $278.70 + $200 as a mandatory hold during the stay. That was the cherry on the cake for sure! Still in the process to have my money back as we speak!\n\nRestaurants wise in Harrison Hot Springs, the only one that looked like a restaurant (Morgan's bistro) was closed! So went to the sushi place next door that was hugely expensive and not that good. Also, try to avoid the Black Forest restaurant that is everything BUT German!

Guests walking down the hall conversing sound like they are talking in your suite and when they get to their room there is usually a loud bang or slam of the door clear as day. You can also hear tv's and conversations from the rooms around you and if you listen close enough you can make out what is being said. Then there is the banging of headboards and I am not going to get into too much detail about that just that it can get annoying at 2am cause they are not secured in a way that prevents them from banging on the wall.

The band was talented and fun to listen\u002Fdance to. Being sat next to an entire wedding made it seem like we were crashing, not having our own celebration. So that was odd...\n\nHere is why my review is two stars.\n\nWe checked in around 3:30 and were assigned a pool view king bed room in the main building. The main building was built in the 1920s.

Oh well, off to the pool, walk around the downtown area, anniversary dinner with family, etc. When it was time to settle in for the night, all heck broke loose.\n\nFirst it was the television on the far side of the room as us. Then the footsteps stampeding above us from 10:30 p.m. well into the wee hours of the morning. There was walking, shouting, laughing in the hallways. Oh, at one point when my husband was using the washroom, he could hear the guy next to us whistling in the shower. Of course there was a symphony of sex from all around us. The thumping of the headboards is bad enough, you'd think people could keep the moaning and shouting to a minimum for the sake of those around them. I think if I had kids with us I'd be a lot more upset about how graphic the noises were. \n\nHere's the true test of how noisy a room really is. Around 7 a.m. we heard a cell phone vibrating. I reached for mine, my husband reached for his. That's when we looked at each other and realized it was our neighbour's cellphone VIBRATING on their end table. How much thinner could the walls be?\n\nAdd to that the noises your own rooms makes, like the bed squeaking and creaking every time you adjust your pillow or roll over at night. We \""woke up\"" exhausted, burning eyes and pounding headaches. Brutal.\n\nAt the time of check out we told the girl we had very little sleep, that the noise is unbearable. She replied with, \""Did you phone the front desk last night to have the issue corrected?\"" I said, \""Well, when it's coming from three different rooms and the hallway, we'd have been on the phone with you all night. It wasn't like one isolated party. You just hear EVERYTHING going on around you!\"" She said, \""Well it's an old building. That's bound to happen.\"" That was it. That was the answer we got. Not good enough.\n\nMy husband took our issue to customer service and a manager was kind enough to talk with him. He offered us a discounted rate for the night, a few free goodies from the cafe and an offer for a complimentary night in the future. We're hestitant to take him up on that but he says the towers are newer and more soundproof. It was nice to be heard and understood. \n\nThe outdoor pools, understandably, have a lot of pine needles, leaves, hairs and dead flies in them. I know it's an uphill battle with outdoor areas but it was a bit unsettling. Maybe a skim every so often would be nice but we didn't notice anything while we were in them or from our pool-view room.\n\nAfternoon tea is over-hyped... nice idea but poorly executed.\n\nI think if we WERE to come back, it would be mid-week, slow season, staying in the tower.",2,negative

We stayed here for two reasons: (1) They are a pet friendly hotel, and (2) we wanted to try the hot springs as we have been trying all the hot springs that we can, that are listed in the book, Hot Springs of Western Canada. We stayed in one of their cabins for a marked down price that included a dog, free access to the hot springs and free breakfast. The cabin was very dated circa 1960 s and was not in good repair. The spider and web that was in the tiny shower did not impress my wife either. The grounds were lovely and well kept. The hot springs consisted of a rather nice indoor pool that was suitably hot and a rather luke warm outer area that was both dated and too shallow for real swimming. The hotel itself is on prime real estate fronting the spectacular beach. This is a public beach that is well kept and reasonably clean .The hotel itself was probably quite impressive in the 1960\u002F70 era but is now starting to need upgrading. The free breakfast was special in all ways. Excellent food of all types, freshly prepared and abundant, a real bargain. Would we stay there again? Yes we would but only if we again received a marked down rate, or if we needed a pet friendly hotel. A good hotel but not great and a reasonable place to stay if you have a pet and if you recognize the age of the facility.",3,negative

Faded and chipped furniture (clearly from the 1960's), bedspread also from that era, a thread-bare carpet and chipping walls (likely lead paint). There was a single \""window\"" that overlooked a gravel-covered roof. No air con. After refusing this beauty (at a mere $ 165\u002Fnight), we were told that luckily, there was a cancellation in one of their \""finer\"" rooms. This was no better. The furniture, still chipped and faded, was from the late 1970s, bedspread and carpet, again, faded, MUCH used; all in all, this would not pass muster in a motel 6. The absolute highlight of our disturbing experience was the bathroom. The sink had a large, non-descript stain (caused by a leaking cheap faucet) that reminded me of mold colonies from my university days. The toilet was barely functional, antique, and made constant \""leaking\"" sounds as the water dripped, whether it had just been flushed or not. In order to close the door to the \""tub room\"", one had to physically step INTO the tub (or onto the toilet). The 'piece de resistance' was the tub. Covered by a thin mouldy shower curtain, equipped with a leaking faucet, and a five-dollar immobile shower head, it was flanked by grimmy, chipped, yellow-stained tiles, which would only be amusing if found in an archeological excavation site. This rare gem was $255! PER NIGHT! No air con, no fans.\nThe pool and the Spa were nice. The management was very helpful and receptive to our concerns. They did admit that the rooms, heh, heh, needed some work. They also allowed us to check out after one harrowing night, and gave us a small discount.\nBottom Line: Visit Harrison Hot Springs, go to the Spa, lounge by the pool, but stay somewhere else! or better yet, just make it a day trip and go home afterwards.\n",1,negative

We stayed in the Junior Suite in the east tower on the 8th floor and had a wonderful time. The room was very spacious, with a mini bar area, 2 couches, 2 balconies, sitting area and a large King Murphy bed. Compared to some of the other east tower rooms we stayed at this room could have used a little refresher or a remodel, however it was still nice. Although it would have been nice to have the rock bathroom just like some of the east tower corner rooms. The mini bar area was a tad empty for its size which I couldn't understand but nothing to really complain too much about. The resort property is pleasant even when its a very rainy and gloomy outside. It's usually much more beautiful during the snowy days. At the very end of the day, the most worth it part of the trip is the 5 pools you have at your disposal at the property. Its truly the icing on the cake and the reason we go back. Even on a cold day the heated outside pool is blissful. Lastly the trip cannot go without a visit to the Village Pizzeria down a block, some of the best Pizza out there.",4,positive

Low ceilings, plenty of pillars to block sight lines, poor lighting, horrible worn carpet, and bland buffet food all contributed to a sub par overall atmosphere.  The large glass wall that looks out to the lake doesn't even save it because the guests were all seated at the far end of the room and all they could see was the balcony railing for the first little bit till the sun went down.  The staff turned the lights practically off maybe to make them look out the pretty window more but that gave the effect of hiding in a dark closet peeking through the crack in the door.   The guests were uncomfortable enough to squint at the window and quietly mutter, but not enough to complain.  \n\nIt just reminded me of my grandmas basement before she remodelled, with the lava carpet, funny smelling walls, and slit windows.\n\nOh and there is no ramp access to the garden for the ceremony that I could see.  \n\nAlternatives: Fraser River Lodge, Rowena's by the River.",2,negative

Wristbands- :( I do love this place with a couple of caveats: This time they were unbelievably stingy with towels and robes for a destination spa, the free afternoon tea is questionable( you get what you pay for) and check your bill carefully before you sign the bill. \nI ventured up to BC with 2 other women, both of whom are regular spa users. We all enjoyed the massages, facials, and mani pedi's we had.  The hot rock massage was one of the best I have had, and the deep tissue massages were excellent. The facials rocked, and we received a great mani pedi. The pools are lovely.  There are nice steam rooms for women and men. There are NO towels anywhere. You need to bring the ONE they give you in your room. If you want a towel to sit on in the steam room, or perhaps another towel after you use the pools in the morning and go to another pool in the afternoon, you will have to ask the front desk. Since this is advertised as a destination spa it's a bit strange. Gone are the stacks of towels by the pool for the guests or towels by the steam room- what's up? This is the first time I have been to a spa and have not received a clean robe (without asking) each day. IMHO this is sub-par.\nWent up with the \""Girlfriends Spa package\"" and we had to re-negotiate our entire bill by showing the front desk our i-pod the special we had signed up for, confirmed by phone and was advertised on their website vs what we were charged. Little things, like the $15 lunch in the spa turned into $20 on our final bill, and a $295 1\u002F2 day special appeared as over $350, etc. After getting a detailed bill from the spa and going over it bit by bit- a time consuming effort, they did take off the extra amount- but this is not fun, and after the lovely relaxing spa a real downer. \nThe rooms are fine. They are clean- a little dated, but nothing to complain about.  The food there is fine. The breakfast buffet was nice.\nThey need to get upgrade or get rid of the free \""Tea and cookies\"" which they offer in the afternoon. No one likes to line up in a fairly long line and show their wristband and room key and be handed a small cup of cold tea and a choice of one or two cookies which are handed to you on a napkin- no dishes. What's up with that? If a hotel can't do it right (and this is not right) then don't do it. My time is precious and free is not in this case.\nHH is in a gorgeous place and the pools are fabulous. The resort could do a much better job by improving on a couple of things- If they advertise a special (and you sign up for it) the front desk should know what it is. Get some nice towels and put them out for your clients. And do something about the afternoon tea, it is worse than free.",4,positive

This stay was as nice as usual but the place is being a bit too pushy with all the TV screens throughout the common lounge areas, it really distracts from the relaxation and comfort and is really ugly and crass. I write this wight the hope that someone from management will read this and remove the row of TVs in the common areas, it really cheapens the feeling of the place. Otherwise the hall on the 4th floor of the E. tower was smelly and old, smelled like wet dog the 3 days we were there, maybe a sign of aging and upgrading not keeping pace with the popularity of the resort. The change rooms at the pool are way too small. All that being said we will probably come back for a weekend next year to warm our bodies - and hopefully our souls.",4,positive

We were given a great meeting room and the service from the staff who replenished our breakfast items and coffee\u002Ftea was excellent.  The property is spread over a few towers and getting lost is common - a map provided on check-in would be very helpful!  Also wall maps sprinkled around the hotel would help as well.  The rooms were comfortable with lovely lake views - but the towels were extremely thin!  We have been there for a women's gathering for a few years now and have always enjoyed the two delicious dinners in the buffet  - latterly an Italian-themed meal and a delicious prime rib night.  During this stay there was an Indian buffet on the Friday and a Chinese themed-meal on the Saturday.  Two Asian buffets on two consecutive nights were not good!  The Indian dishes were 90% too spicy - I could eat the roast potatoes and the bread but everything else was way too \""hot\""!  They charge $20 for the buffet - not appropriate for what we got!  The Chinese buffet had a better balance of too hot vs edible but the quality of the food in both buffets was definitely not up to the high standard we expect at the Harrison.  We heard there is a new chef - his all-Asian choices for the buffet were very poor.  Bring back the wonderful Prime Rib and the Italian buffets - if not we all may decide to eat at some of the numerous restaurants in Harrison village!",3,negative

The omelette station looked amazing for those who like omelettes (hubby wishes he had gotten up in time at least once).

I finally was able to go (Aug 06, 2004), and boy was I disappointed.  Everything went well at the beginning and it progressively got worst.\n\nDining:\nWe went to the famous Copper Room where fine dining can be had.  Well, the food was good.  The service was, let\u2019s say, a little slow. It took us over three hours to finish dinner. There were very few people there (30% occupied.).  The drinks were watered down. $10 for a simple watered down drink was way overpriced.  Dinner was so-so. I could have better food at Applebee\u2019s or TGI Fridays. The bill for one person (one salad, dinner and one drink) ended up to cost us $80 CAN. We did not have dessert since it was closing time. As I said - slow service.\n\nRooms:\nWe got their \u201Cbest suite\u201D and fully renovated.  It was not even close to my interpretation as \u201Cbest\u201D if even \u201Cgood\u201D room.  I\u2019ve stayed in Econo Lodges or Motel 6 with better amenities. The bathroom was very large. The beds were lumpy. The A\u002FC unit requires us to purchase ear-plugs. Everything was very run down.  My sister said that this \u201Croom\u201D was much better than the \u201Chole-in-the-wall\u201D she got. The only consolidation was that her room had no A\u002FC so she got a good night\u2019s sleep.\n\nCalling for reservations:\nWell, I take it that they \u201Cmay be buzy\u201D since it took me over 30 minutes to get someone on the line. Once I spoke to the reservation person, she seemed very disinterested in providing me info.\n\nSprings:\nIf they tell you it\u2019s natural, it\u2019s definitely not. There was so much chlorine that it was watering up my eyes. I am a swimmer and I know what chlorine is. The staff says that they do not use any chemicals whatsoever. Not to mention, I saw them put the chlorine tablets in at 5AM.  The smell is even more prevalent in the indoor pools.  Water was also very murky. Oh. Some of the chairs were moldy. There was at least a month\u2019s worth of mold. You can see the streaks where people\u2019s suit happened to have touched if you know what I mean.\n\nCustomer Service:\nWell, do I need to say more? The bell hop was more helpful than the people at the desk.  \n\nWe traveled in two cars but one car broke down at 10PM.  We called the hotel to ask for directions or to have them call a taxi for us. The clerk told us to walk it. It\u2019s not too far. 2 hours and at midnight \u2013 the group in the second car arrived by foot. \n\nThe 2nd car also asked the clerk to let the first car group (already checked in) to inform us of the delay (e.g. note or voice-mail would have sufficed) . The clerk informed them that they cannot do it. I went to the desk a few times to ask if anyone has asked for us and was told that nobody called.

These remain unchanged.\n\nThe buffet at the lakeside restaurant was a huge disappointment. We always looked forward to the variety offered (prime rib was great) and quality of food. This visit we were asked to prepay for our meal! I found this very odd and as a well traveled family have never come across this before, McDonald's?. The food selection was mainly Chinese and not very good Chinese at that. I would recommend eating in town and avoiding the resort restaurants ($100+ for a mediocre buffet is a joke)\n\nThe biggest disappointment was what has happened to the pools! They have turned into party central! They implemented a wrist band policy to weed out people using the pools who aren't staying at the resort. Well this apparently does not work as the four of us and another family were the only ones with the bands. There were large groups of people coming over the fence by the cabins with coolers, radios etc. people were smoking in the family pool, playing music, wasted drunk at 9pm, had wine bottles and glasses around the edge of the pools, beer bottles etc etc. the only time we saw a hotel employee outside was at 10pm on the Friday night to kick any kids out as it turned into adults only. \nThe following morning there were cigarette butts and beer cans all over the place, do they not do a walk through to at least pick up garbage? \n\n Seeing as the resort is usually booked to almost capacity every time we visit they must be making enough money to staff the pool area!?  \n\nIt's sad they have let the resort slip to this level.

The settting is beautiful and the hot springs very enjoyable.\nThe resort however, seems to rely on this and the fact that it has a good sized dance floor and good live music. We recently spent two nights there on the \""New's Year's Copper Room Package\"", which was highly overrated. The accommodations are sadly in need of updating. I wish I could say that the rooms are clean and comfotable, but they are not.  We had a double queen room, even though we requested a king months in advance. The head board juts out from the wall about four inches, making it quite uncomfortable to sit up in bed. Normally I would not complain about such a small thing, but the fact that there was an inch of dust on it did not help. It appeared that the desk was the only item in the whole room that was not coated in dust. \nWe have stayed in the the tower rooms and the west wing and both need updating.\n\nWe noticed that, other than the main lobby, the whole hotel seemed to need a good dusting, I could write my name in the dust on the consoles by the elevators.\n\nThe front desk staff were polite and pleasant, but  when we arrived at 3:45 for our 4:00 PM check in, they acted as though they were doing us a great favour by offering us the WIfi code while we were waiting!   Since  the wait to check in was long, they told us to go to the guest services office to pick up our keys in an hour or so. This did not help since there was no one in that office. \n\nOur first night we had a snack in the Island bar.  It should be easy to make nachos for two satisfying and  fresh tasting, but the effort was not there. They tasted like the packaged variety that come with  a seasoning envelope. \n\nThe resort offers nice touches for free, but again, they do not put any effort in and act as though their customers are unruly children. For example, there is free \""afternoon tea\"" offered.\nNice, but it really means tea, and only tea. There is no coffee and no herbal or decaf tea. Staff stand behind a  table and hand out a cup of tea  and your choice of cookie or loaf cake. \n\nOur package included a bottle of wine so we contacted the room service operator and asked if we could have it with our dinner in the Copper Room. No problem we were told, they would deliver it to our room, and we could bring it along to supper ourselves. What they did not mention was that there would be a $30 corking fee for a bottle that was part of our package. I would have overlooked this if the staff had not been so condescending .\nWe were made to feel that we had committed some type of faux pas, which was not a good way to start the evening.\n\nOur meal was mediocre at best.  There were several courses, true, but other than the main, which was oversalted and tasted a like frozen dinner, the others were definitely all flourish and no substance.  At our table of four, only one of us was able to detect a miniscule piece of goat cheese in the goat cheese\u002Fbeet terrine.\n\nAfter the main course was served, our waiter could not be found. We were not offered coffee.\nDessert was again, bland and tasteless, althought the plate of three tidbits looked lovely. When a small plate with one macaroon and one chocolate ( per person)   arrived sometime around 11:00 PM, we joked that maybe this was the  promised \""late night snack\"". Sadly the joke was on us.\n\n It did not help that, although we only one of us had a cocktail, and the rest shared the one bottle of wine, we were presented with a bill of almost $700. We were told that $560 would be deducted at the end, this being the value placed on the meal portion of our package (one dinner for four).  Perhaps a reminder of what value we were expected to tip on?\n\nThe New Year's Day brunch was much better, with a wide variety of options which were good quality. It was comparable to any higher end hotel brunch, although most would offer gluten free items which were non existent here.  Unfortunately, although we arrived on time, it still took almost 15 minutes to get out first cup of coffee.

Lots of table and chairs, flowers, shrubs etc. The hotel is nestled in the forest and mountains, absolutely beautiful. \n\nThe cons...just about everything else. I have frequented this hotel for many years, the common areas are in desperate need of updating. The carpets are stained and quite disgusting. There was a overwhelming smell of disinfectant in the hallways, to the point where we blocked our noses. The furniture in the common areas are banged up pretty bad as are the walls in the hallways. Although there was no line up to check in, it still took way too long, about 15-20 minutes. The rooms are adequate, ours was updated, but it was strange to find a coverless duvet on our bed, using two flat sheets instead? That I have never seen before! It also took the hot water forever to get to the shower. We had to turn it on and wait about 10 minutes. Crazy. \n\nI love going for the location and hot springs, but if this hotel was picked up and put somewhere else...I would venture a guess that it would go out of business. \n\nI could probably overlook some of this if we didn't pay over $500. for 2 nights in a room with a fridge in the closet, yup the closet, and 1 king bed. (this price included nothing but the room and was in the beginning of Dec.) \n\nI have gone with children, and if you can get a mid week package deal, it is a fun family get away. \n\nI wish they would restore this poor old hotel, I do believe it has the ability to be grand!",3,negative

The water pipes in the west tower were very loud and there was a poorly disguised water stain on the wall in the washroom. By far, the worst part of this trip was the Copper Room. We purchased the getaway package, which included dinner for two at the Copper Room. When making the reservation a month prior to our stay, I had requested they put a candle or sparkler on my boyfriends' dessert as we were celebrating his birthday. They agreed and said it would be no problem. Then they forgot. Many people around us were getting sparklers and they completely forgot about us. To add insult to injury, the dinner for two actually meant we had to select from a chef's menu on which the only option for a starter was a cream based soup. I'm lactose intolerant so they gave me a few pieces of lettuce on a plate with some dressing instead. Not what you expect from a supposed high end restaurant. The final insult was that I was up all night with food poisoning from the striploin they served. When I reported all of this to the front desk in the morning at check out, they assured me the food and beverage manager would be in touch with me the same day to make things right. Never called. I've been working in hospitality for 7 years in Vancouver and never in my time have i ever allowed any guest to be regarded so poorly.\nI am extremely disappointed especially given the premium price I paid for the package.",2,negative

We really enjoy the atmosphere, the lake in the summer and the hot spring pools... the kids absolutely love the pools because of all the other families with kids.\n\nI would love to write a fully raving review but the one thing that has consistently surprised me is the lack of attention to detail and cleanliness of the hotel rooms. A room that costs over $180\u002Fnight should be spic and span as far as I'm concerned.  I'm not sure if the hotel is understaffed and they don't have the time needed to clean the rooms better but I don't think it's acceptable in most higher end North American hotels to have obvious traces left behind from previous occupants. \n\nI also think that with the amount of revenue the hotel must generate, that they should be applying renovations to really bring the appearance and atmosphere up a notch... base boards and trim, or even paint?\n\nThe staff are very friendly and the food is good.. although it seems for the price of $18(breakfast)-$26(dinner) per person, the buffet does not contain much of a selection during certain times of the year when we've been there.\n\nWe will still continue to visit this hotel out of convenience and have a great time while there but I will definitely talk to a manager next time and pass these thoughts along.",4,positive

The east tower also has balconies and it can be hit and miss in other sections. The staff is really good though and there are many beautiful pools, they even have adult swim time in one of the pools after a certain time.

To make a long story short-a group of drunks were in the pools being loud, rude, and disrespectful towards other guests. Complaints were made, multiple times, and the hotel did absolutely nothing to stop this issue. Guests who were fed up then took matters into their own hands, one thing led to another, and a full on fist fight broke out right in the pools. Hotel staff came out, and stood and watched with other horrified guests. Children left in tears and guests were left frightened. Police took 30 minutes to arrive, and while waiting for them the unruly bunch ran around screaming at innocent guests, taunting them and intimidating them. Police came, things settled, but they didn't kick the unruly group out, they actually went missing after the police left. I wonder how this even happened. They were found and kicked at 3 hours later. This issue must be addressed to have a safe environment for those coming to relax, not participate in a drunken pool brawl.

While other people may find the sameness of the 'big chain' hotels\u002Fmotels and fast food franchises appealing, I found it so refreshing to find a spot that's a little bit different.  Yes, it is an older hotel which may not have all (but does have most of) the modern amenities, but it does have character, charm and a certain panache.  We had a pool view room, which offered a lovely view of both the outdoor pools and the mountains behind the hotel.  We thoroughly enjoyed our leisurely dinner in the Copper Canyon Room.  One reviewer noted with apparent disgust that the dinner took three hours.  The reason for this is that the entertainment provided allows for diners to actually get up and dance throughout the meal - a lovely reminder of a bygone era.   The breakfast buffet offered a good selection to suit everyone.  The pools were amazing - we tried every single one of them.  It rained during our visit and I cannot describe how soothing it was to be floating in the outdoor hot pool, gazing up at the mountains, with rain drops falling on my head (especially at night, when all the trees are lit by mini lights....).  \nLocally - there are trails, the lake, the mountains, restaurants, tourist attractions - I don't know what more you could ask for.\nI have travelled quite extensively and I would return to Harrison Hot Springs Resort before I would return to some of the more exotic spots I have visited.\n",4,positive

The proximity to and view of the lake are nothing short of marvelous.  The hotel, itself, is a little past its prime, but still a nice and peaceful place to stay.  It was annoying that there was no soap dish in the shower and no place to plug in the clock on the bedside stand and, instead of complimentary bottled water, it was $3.50 a bottle.   Other than that, the room was comfortable and a great place to relax.  The complimentary newspaper was a nice touch.  There really isn't much else in the area except a small town with a nice variety of restaurants, souvenir shops, and bare bones grocery stores, all of which charge tourist prices.  The best place to eat is in the hotel itself.  The Copper Room has a comprehensive dinner menu and the food is delicious.  The breakfast buffet is excellent and leaves you wanting to skip lunch.  The food in the bar is also great.  We were surprised in the bar when we ordered a combination platter to snack on and, although we didn't complain, the server refused to charge us because she didn't think the spinach dip looked up to par.  How often does that happen?  The 4 PM tea and dessert in the lobby is a stupendous way to round out a restful day.  I can't much comment on the spa itself except to say that people say they enjoy using it.  I'm not into hot water, especially shared with people whose health and hygiene habits I don't know. I do, however, know that I can sit transfixed in the bar by the window and sip a pale ale while watching the horde of hummingbirds that hang for hours around the feeder.

The room was ok although the balcony was miniscule. Everything was clean though the bathroom faucet leaked at the base and there were a couple cigarette burns in the carpet. The killer for us was the A\u002FC. The room was 25C when we arrived so I turned on the A\u002FC before we went out (stat set to 20C) and the room was 27C when we got back two hours later. I checked it and turned the stat to 15C yet the air coming in was still warm. I told the desk and an engineer was there within 15 minutes (good) and he told me the outside air temp was just above when the chiller kicks in. I'm a stationary engineer myself so I know how these systems work - I said that since the rooms were hot the free cooling set point was too high. He said there's nothing he could do. This is unacceptable for a place charging $180 a night minimum! The system was quite capable of cooling the rooms but they keep the set point high to save money even though the guests cook.

Room wise the Main Hotel rooms are smaller and not really family friendly unless you get the Family Suite which has two rooms.

The room had no AC and not a hint of a cross breeze, and finding an extra fan in this relic of a resort was like pulling teeth.

There is pool bar too that make decent drinks and not too pricey. We had a mojito and it was nice and strong. The resort provides two adult bathrobes and none for the kids. We just took the towels to wrap them in as it can be very cold when you step out of the pool. The afternoon tea service was a nice touch. It is usually from 4 to 4:30 pm. Lemon tea and assorted cakes and cookies. There is a microwave too in the lobby that we used to warm our kids' milk. Our room had partial views of the lake. The room itself was really nice. There's a small cooler in the room to store water etc. The beds were comfortable. There's a coffee machine and a nice balcony too. The bathrooms were very spacious. The Wi-Fi is spotty. There is a Wi-Fi zone in the resort right where they have the tea service. In our room, Wi-Fi was strongest in the bathroom.

It definitely used to be a little tidier, but it is getting better.\n\nI still really enjoy coming here. My sister even got married here. It was pretty simple for her. They had onsite catering, wedding planning, hair, makeup, etc. \n\nThey have rooms that are pretty basic for less money and nicer rooms that cost more. I always think the basic rooms are fine because I don't spend much time inside. I believe the rooms in the tower are newer. My favorite rooms are the pool walk outs.\n\nIn winter, it is beautiful with the snow. The hot springs keep you cozy. In summer, the hot springs are still nice, and you can enjoy the cold pool. \n\nThere are often a lot of kids though, which makes relaxing hard. I used to be one of them. There is an adult pool, but it is pretty hot. You can't stay in there forever. \n\nThe pools are nestled in the mountains, and the view is great. The resort is easy on the eyes and there are fun nooks and crannies to find. The gardens are also beautiful. \n\nI love the breakfast. The hazelnuts and muesli are AWESOME! It always makes my trip when they give me a free breakfast. That doesn't happen too often anymore. \n\nMany people go to the Copper Room. I have never actually been, but my family has gone. They were not that into it. They said it was a very LONG experience. They had multiple courses and there was dancing. My family does enjoy dancing typically, but it seemed to be targeted at older folks. They said they just wanted it to be over, so they could go swim in the pools. \n\nThere is a spa, but I think it is too pricey. They have a small kids activity center and exercise room.\n\nThere are fun activities around this area. You can stroll the main promenade and visit the small shops. Go to the Black Forest Restaurant. It is soo good! When it's warmer there are lots of water sport activities to do on the lake. There is also hiking in the parks nearby. You can also take short walks in the beautiful woods right next to the resort. You even see the original source of the hot springs. I like going to Morris Valley Stables for trail ride. In fall they also have a sand sculpture building contest like you wouldn't believe. It is so cool! \n\nThe resort is also pet friendly. It costs extra though. \n\nI would give it a try.

However, if you're just going for a meal, it's not what I would consider to be a fine dining experience or service. Don't get me wrong, service was good and food was good, but not a fine dining quality. Decor was perfectly preserved from the late 80s. \n\nWe upgraded ourselves to a West Wing with a balcony that over looked the lake; the view was gorgeous. The soft furnishing renovations to their bed skirts, and scarves definitely made the room a little more modern to an otherwise authentically 80s looking room. Liked the bug screen to the balcony.\n\nMy friends who check out the pool were a little horrified at the scantily clad couples who spent most of their time in the indoor hot tub and pool making out. Granted that this was about 11pm at night. Nothing the hotel could have done - but just a heads up for those who are more accustomed to the more modestly dressed and general propriety. It is great how the hotel's indoor pool is open until late - 1pm.

And they even have some adult only time, so they do have some things figured out.\n\nThat being said, everything else about this hotel is awful. They have the location and the springs so they have let the rest fall apart and still charge a ton. We stayed here at the end of June 2015\n\nFirst, the service. At check-in was OK, but they sent us to someone else's room, we entered and there was some sort of meal set up for someone else. We waited around for them to pick it up and they never did, so we brought it down ourselves. We also got woken up by room service the next morning, which is a HUGE pet peeve of mine, they have lists of people that check out, there is NO excuse for that. Then at check out and there were fees we were not warned about.\n\nOther than that, the amenities don't justify the price. No elevator in the lobby so you have to carry your bags up the stairs, no AC (don't go in the summer) in the rooms, bathroom fixtures that don't work, a shower with water pressure that varies with others' use, no fan, and not even 2 double beds. Not to mention the old decor and just slight smell of old.\n\nI don't recommend",1,negative

No AC which I was told about, but the room fit our needs space wise.  There were ceiling fans in each room and extra fans available on the floor.

This is a review of the hot springs policy, the staff, and the surrounding area for those who were similarly confused by the hotel's purposefully misleading Website. The takeaways:\n\n#1: You cannot use these hot springs unless you a) stay at the hotel or b) pay $100 per person minimum to get a spa treatment. Although the hot springs are and should be a resource that the public can use for a fee (as they are at every other site I've ever been to), for some reason, city interests have allowed this private company to limit access to this natural resource. You cannot buy a day pass for less than $200. Even after careful researching, this wasn't clear to me and my traveling companion, and we drove from Vancouver to use the springs. No deal.\n\n#2-What makes things worse is how rude the staff are. My sister and I attempted to talk to one of the hotel clerks and a manager. Our impression is similar to the thousands of others who have found the staff rude and unaccommodating. The manager argued that we couldn't pay a fee to use the springs because of liability; in the same sentence, she said that we could pay $100 each to get a spa treatment and use the springs (just not on that day).\n\nIf you don't have a reason to be in this area, I would skip it. There are natural hot springs in Olympic National Park and north\u002Feast of Harrison Hot Springs. \n\n#3: The town is kind of a dump. Someone has mismanaged it. The view at Harrison Lake is spectacular, but the food, surrounding restaurants, and park are all dingy.

The resort, however, seems to lack in planning abilities. Actually, there is planning involved from their part, planning to make guests wait. When we arrived at the appointed time (4:00 pm), there were already signs that things were off: the parking area for check-ins was full, staff in front of the hotel were frantic and the lobby was overcrowded. The presence of a long velvet rope and placards ordering people to line up added to the overall impression of something more ominous. After being made to wait 30 minutes along with about 50 other people, we were told that our room was not ready and to go for a walk!!! \n\nIt appears the resort did not have enough staff to clean the rooms by the promised time.\n\nWalking we did but, without a room key, we could not get anywhere within the hotel and the watchful staff was eager to make its presence known and advise us of that fact. Interestingly enough, there was available staff to invite us to go outside.\n\nAn hour later, we had to line up again and wait yet another 20 minutes before being handed our room key. And we were the lucky ones: others had to come back more often e.g. another couple with a baby had to come back three times to get theirs.\n\nThere is not have much to say about the amenities: we could not get ready on time to make our dinner reservation at the hotel restaurant and cancelled it. Understandably, there is no review for it. The room in the East Tower was adequate but nothing out of the ordinary. Parts of the resort are quite dated and in obvious need of renovation. Parking is crowded and the stalls much too narrow for anything bigger than a compact vehicle. Like us, we saw many other couples forced to let their passengers out before parking and the driver carefully exiting.\n\nOne bright spot: we could check on via the in-room TV and not have to deal with the staff and the resort any longer than we had to.",1,negative

Unfortunately I was a little disappointed. Check in and out are very slow - not sure if they need more staff but the process was onerous. Tried to check out via the TV option but it was not working. The majority of the hotel needs updating - our room was very tired looking and the carpets desperately need to be cleaned well or replaced. We booked a room with a balcony on the lake side in order to enjoy the view of the lake - which was beautiful. However the balcony was covered in dirt, cobwebs and numerous spiders. When we weren't enjoying the lake we were watching some amazing web building! The bathtub had the non-slip product removed except for the glue which was still on the tub. The drain did not work and showers were taken in ankle deep water. There was not a drain plug for the sink. \nWe dined in the Copper Room on one evening as part of our stay and ordered off of the Chef's menu. Salad and dessert were fine but the sole had a fishy odor and the steak was not prepared as requested. We thoroughly enjoyed the live band. The hot spring pools were fine. The breakfast buffet was tasty and we enjoyed 2 breakfasts on the patio overlooking the lake. Servers we efficient and cheery. All in all I was disappointed - if you are going for the hot spring pools and don't mind the cleanliness and okay food - which by the way was not inexpensive - then you may enjoy your stay.",3,negative

We asked for a higher room (the higher, the better, with a view of the south end of Harrison Lake).  When we checked in, we were taken to our room on the third floor. The main floor is the lobby. The second floor is the convention center. The third floor is the lowest floor that can be occupied by overnighting humans.  Could they not have done a bit better than this? As we arrived at the third floor, my sweet bride said \""Let's hope it is not a room next to the elevator shaft.\"" Of course, it was.  I thought this was the room to which an angry clerk assigned guests who were being punished; we hadn't been there long enough to sin! \n\nThe shower was huge (room for three or four people) and had a hand-held shower head which was delightful.  The toilet was ridiculously low, built about as close to the ground as your average benjo in Tokyo. Standing back up, after being seated, was a callisthenic event in the last Olympic Games held in Canadia. The front desk kindly sent housekeeping up with a sort of elevator cushion device which added altitude.  \n\nThe room had a lovely balcony overlooking the lake. There was a sign on the sliding screen door leading to the balcony.  It said something like \""This is a wilderness area. Please keep the screens closed to keep sand fleas out of your room.\""  We were willing to comply, but wondered why there were four small windows, all openable, none of which had screens at all. \n\nDinner at the Copper Room was perhaps the high point of our stay.  It deserves a separate review and I will write one. \n\nWe spent a good deal of time in the various hot pools.  People pass through the lobby day and night dressed in terrycloth robes, passing people who are dressed in \""casual resort clothing.\""  We have an important message for the hotel: when it comes to terrycloth robes, one size definitely does not fit all.  There should be a variety of larger and smaller sizes available.  \n\nThe routine coming and going of bathing people was interrupted regularly by the march of the wedding people.  There are weddings scheduled day and night, weekdays and weekends, at the Harrison.  They, too, must process through the terrycloth people to reach the wedding venue or one of the ballrooms for a reception.  This is a fun mix of people.  \n\nMy bride loved the spa.  There were kids in the adults-only pool and no staff there to tell parents to get their darling daiperlings out of where they did not belong.  There was a fire down the lake which started on Sunday and was still burning on Tuesday when we left.  They told us that, so long as the wind blew away from the village, we would all be safe.

Our room turned out to be a disappointment. The bathroom looked old and worn out and just wasn't very clean (I found dark hairs on the floor everywhere). The wallpaper was old and dirty, the curtains felt like from another century and the bed was very small. All the furniture in the room had marks from heavy use and were clearly past their prime. The whole room could use a make-over.\n\nThe room did not have airconditioning, but the ceiling fan was enough to keep us cool (it wasn't very warm when we stayed here). The room we stayed in was very noisy. You could hear every noise in the hallway and also the noises in the nearby rooms. The hotel has a strict policy that you should be quiet after 23u, which is totally understandable when your rooms are clearly not noise proof.\n\nThe breakfast was nice though, with lots of hot and cold options to choose from. Although I found a hair in the dried fruit the first day. Seems like unwanted hair is a bit of a problem in this hotel. I have to say I really loved the made to order omelet.

Every time I called down to request something, or ask a question, they were very polite and prompt.  \nThe hotel is a bit pricey - we paid 209+tax for our room a night, but in my opinion, the price is worth it for access to their pools.  They have 5 pools - an adult, a lap pool, a kids pool, and two indoor pools.  The outdoor pools are open until 11:00pm, and then the indoor pools are open until 1:00am - which gives you lots of time to check them out.

data\ca\154931\183786\304185427.html,Harrison Hot Springs Resort &amp; Spa,"""We booked Harrison Hot Springs Resort for two nights after our wedding as a relaxing getaway and time to unwind. I had read on here to avoid the main building as it is dated and there is no A\u002FC, so we booked into the East Wing with a lake view (one of the pricier options). I'm thankful we did that as the view, I have to say, was stunning. Probably one of the best views I've had from a hotel. But really, that's where the good news stops in all honesty. \n\nTo begin with, check-in wasn't too pleasant. We arrived at about 3pm (one hour prior to check-in admittedly) and we expected the room would likely be ready. Most hotels have the room ready well prior to your check-in. Anyway, after lining up for 15 minutes we were told it's not ready yet and to return in 20 minutes as the cleaners were just finishing, no big deal. We go for a stroll around the beach and return probably 30 minutes later. After another 15 minute line up, again we are told the room isn't ready. It's now 4 o clock, when check in should be, so surely the room should be ready? The lady serving us goes back in the office and I suspect calls the cleaners and tells them to hurry up. She comes out 5 minutes later and tells us the room is now ready. Not a huge deal overall, but I find it a bit disorganized when check in is at 4pm and the room isn't ready when you come to check in at 4. Finally, once we arrived to our room, we didn't have any robes provided as all guests are, so we had to call guest services to bring us some. They did so promptly so it wasn't an issue, but these minor things start adding up and make you feel like the place isn't such a high quality after all. Also, we were surprised there no slippers provided to guests, considering everyone is provided robes and the pools are the main attraction of the entire hotel with people walknig through the lobby in robes all day, you would suspect slippers are a necessity. I had to wear my sneakers to the pool and back, which wasn't great. \n\nOur main grievance though was the \""hot springs\"". I use quotation marks as you could really never tell they were hot springs at all. Whilst pleasant and warm, there was no inclination at all that the water came from a natural spring. It merely felt like a heated, chlorinated pool. Even the setting was very Sandals Resort like. I was expecting it to be a bit more natural and tranquil, but it was really an overflowing pool area largely full of children. We found them far from relaxing, even in the evening at 9.30pm when you would expect most children to be heading to bed, it was packed. The adult pool even more so, you were rubbing shoulders the entire time. This was midweek too, heaven knows what it's like on a weekend! Why have the adult pool immediately next to the childrens pool as well? There was no respite from children, even when in the adults pool. I was under the impression the pools were segregated, so the adult pool would be tranquil. Nope, it's right next to the childrens pool, pointless.\n\nThe majority of our trip was resting on the hot springs so when they failed to live up to expectation you are kind of left out to dry. After spending some time on the beach, walking a few (short) trails and visiting Hicks Lake, there is very little to do in Harrison. One night we spent the entire time in our room and watched TV with room service as we simply didn't have much to do. \n\nAnother grievance we had was the cleanliness of certain areas. Whilst the room itself was decent, the balcony was nothing short of disgusting. Spiders webs, dead bugs, you name it. It hadn't been cleaned in months. I get that you don't need to clean it for each guest, but once a week or so surely. It really put us off using the balcony much. \n\nGenerally the hotel feels a bit dated and the price seemed a bit high in hindsight. Overall I just think Harrison isn't all it was made out to be, the place and the resort. We left without any intention of returning to either.\n\nWe did enjoy the breakfasts in the morning at the Lakeside Cafe though, they were quite good and not overly pricey (assuming you can eat a lot like me!)",3,negative

Also, surprisingly enough we had to come up to the information desk a few times to get our Accra cards recharged because they just wouldn't work. The little cafes at the resort do not offer high quality food, but only simple dishes and snacks ( which also were not very yummy ) . Over all, we did enjoy the nature and the walks around the resort and the forest trails but the resort and the service itself cannot be rated anything more than 2*, so the extra star goes for the location, nothing else!",3,negative

It is $40 upgrade if you want a airconditioned room. It is a simply horrible business\u002Fmarketing stratetegy they employ. So, if you are staying there in late May\u002FJune\u002FJuly\u002FAugust\u002FEarly Sept, DO NOT stay in the main building or the most basic room. It is too hot and inhabitable. The Harrison Hot Spring and Fraser Valley gets much hotter than in Vancouver and Lower Mainland in summer.  No room without air-conditoining today should be offered to customers. period. However, it would not be bad if you are staying there during winter. One more thing. Yea. other reviewers are right. The main building doesn't smell very nice; slightly musty and old. \n\nNow, an airconditioned room cost me $209 minus 10% off, so that's about 188. (being entertainment member). It only costs $139 at the Harrison beach hotel or $130 at Executive hotel if you want a similar room in these hotels. Just to give you some perspective, a king bed at Hyatt Regency Vancouver (4star) was only $160 at the time.\n\nThe main difference between Harrison resort from the other hotel is its pools, which are very nice and well-maintain and clean. Would you pay $50~60\u002Fday for the pools?? It is your choice. \n\nIt is expensive, but worth it if you have kids and visit with a partner. Not many hotels in BC are kids-friendly. This hotel and the pool are; they will keep kids entertained. For adults, it is absolutely relaxing to dip yourself in warm hot spring water and gaze at stars in the sky while night wind pleasantly chills your upper body down. I was dead tired before this trip. Now I am all charged up. \n\nAnd No.. You cannot just buy a pool pass. You need to be a registered guest.\n\nI will go back during a slow-season when they offer B&B for $99 and when i don't need air conditioning. or if they install air-conditioning in the mainbuilding rooms. \n\nRecommend for\n-family vacation\n-midweek, weekend getaway\n\nNot recommended for\n-honeymoon (relaxing but not romantic)",3,negative

There are many signs posted around the pools explaining the rules: no diving, jumping, roughhousing, etc., unfortunately children don't care and either do the staff. The rules are not reinforced by the hotel staff, which makes for a horrible stay for couples who are there for a romantic getaway. It was more like going to the recreation centre pool (anything goes) , than a place for relaxing. My wife and I were put in a suite on the 3rd floor and to our surprise our room was slanted with a slope of about 10 centimetres or more. It was like being inside the leaning tower of pisa, I wonder if an engineer has checked the safety of the building as it seems dangerous and an accident waiting to happen. They placed us in a room with a family above us, their childen woke us up early every morning and used the floor as a trampoline. We phoned the front desk once but it did not help the situation. It is quite sad when a hotel full of fond memories turns into a hotel of your worst nightmares. I would recommend this so called romantice resort to people who have hyperactive children who want to make new friends as the pools are filled with many kids, not someone who wants to enjoy a peaceful, relaxing, romantic getaway. They do have an adult pool but its too hot to stay in for longer than 20 minutes. We passed on our concerns to the hotel manager Barry, he said that he would call us later in the week, he never did.

Even though the hotel was probably only at about half capacity (being midweek at the end of October) it was pretty noisy by the pools and since they are open until the early hours of the morning this must have been off putting for people staying in the rooms directly by them. \n\nThe east tower corridor had a horribly musty old smell to it but the room itself was wonderful. Nice and large, VERY comfortable bed and pillows and a small balcony to the side with a partial lake view (this was nice but probably not worth paying extra for a balcony as it was smaller than expected). \n\nBreakfast in the lakeside cafe was good and had a beautiful view. It was buffet style with hot and cold options and a good pasty selection then they had a chef cooking custom made omelettes which were delicious! My only downside to breakfast was that again in height of summer must have long queues for buffet although it is on for a few hours and although our package said breakfast was included tax was not (not huge problem just slight surprise)\n\nThe pools were lovely. There were 5 including the 2 indoor pools. One of the outdoor pools was adults only which was nice and there was access to a pool side bar (although we didn't get chance to use it). I would not like to go in the summer though as I imagine it would get uncomfortably crowded. As it was we had good space in each pool to feel like we were not in the way of other people and even do a few laps in the long colder (although still nice and warm) pools. The hotel provides towels and robes in the rooms which can be taken down and used around the pool which was awesome. Only issue my boyfriend had being quite tall and sturdily built was that the robes are all one size but this was not a big issue.\n\nThe spa was very nice and relaxing - we had the couple massage. It was relatively expensive but lasted almost a full hour and was a full body massage including some exfoliating treatment and great smelling aromatherapy. \n\nThe eagle boat tour was AMAZING! Easily the highlight of the entire trip. Our guide Tony was informative and happy to answer questions and provide interesting commentary. The tour only took 8 people at a time which was part of what made it so successful! And we saw so many bald eagles (easily a couple of hundred). Unfortunately we didn't see any bear but sometimes they can also be seen there feasting on the end of the salmon run. \n\nOnly other thing to add is be aware that many of the shops off the resort in the little village square close down after summer season or have very reduced hours. And don't make the mistake of eating at the lakeside restaurant (more like a diner) - both myself and partner was very sick after fish and chips there (perhaps not so fresh as it was off season and we were the only customers). \n\nOverall would definitely go again and particularly at this time of year. Would never stay in the other hotels though since this is the one with the hot springs pools. ",4,positive

It's important to read the reviews and understand what the property is and isn't.  Previous reviews cover all the important facts, but I will re-iterate a few key ones that you may find helpful.\n\nThis is not the Four Seasons or St. Regis ot Las Vegas, it's a resort but don't expect too much, and it's likely the best place in the area.  You're in a fairly remote area and the rates (though variable) are more than reasonable for the experience.  \n\nIf you have a bit of extra time and you're traveling from the west, I recommend taking Highway & (Lougheed) as it's quite scenic, although it does add a little bit of time.\n\nThe resort does a great job of adjusting rates and having various specials to keep occupancy high regardless of the season or day of the week.  If you're looking to have a romantic super quiet place to yourself, this probably isn't it.\n\nThere are children - it's a family resort.  While we don't have children, the adult pool has never had children when we have been on property.  Keep in mind that the pools are open early in the morning and until late at night, with adults only very late night allowed in the entire area.\n\nThe Lakeside Cafe is a decent option compared to other places in town, especially for breakfast.  If you have the option for a breakfast special or package, it's a decent buffet with a great fresh omelette station.  Yes, it gets busy at times, but relax and enjoy or go early or late.\n\nThere are limited options in town for just about everything.  There is a gas station store, a liquor store and some souvenir stores.  If you must have a particular brand of water, or a special snack or bottle of wine, bring it with you.\n\nThe property is old - as many have mentioned, the East Tower is generally the best overall bet although it costs a little bit more.  If you want more space and privacy, there are a number of cabins that cost more that are detached.  They are basic, and quaint, and you must walk outside to the property or pools (and no Wifi).  This is part of the charm and we have never had any issues as described by others with regard to cleanliness et al.\n\nI can not speak for the Copper Room as we have never had dinner then as of yet.\n\nThere is a decent exercise room as well.\n\nIt's stunningly beautiful in scenery any time of year, different times of year feature different types of experiences.\n\nIn all my visits, all of the staff have been absolutely fantastic when it comes to service.\n\nNot only that, but in this instance we had car trouble on the way there, and thought we may need to turn a one night stay into a two night stay, but unsure at check in.\n\nOur check in agent went out of her way to ensure a room was blocked for us despite the property being sold out, and advised that we wouldn't incur any cancellation fees, should our car be fixed at some point the following day.\n\nNo property is perfect, even when you pay over $1000 a night or stay at the finest properties in the world.  \n\nAs a frequent traveler, what sets properties apart is the ability to effectively manage and resolve unique or unanticipated guest requests and address issues timely and with appropriate service recovery.\n\nAs I mentioned we have never had any issues that we've needed to address at the property but the way our situation was handled was top notch ensuring we weren't stranded or having to find another play to stay the following day.\n\nThis creates loyalty and recommendations as far as I'm concerned more than any loyalty program.\n\nThank you staff and management and we look forward to returning soon for another great experience!",5,positive

Earlier this month, I stayed in the main hotel for four nights - a Junior Suite and quite nice.  We had a king size bed and a view of the lake - no balcony, didn't miss it.  The suite included a nice livingroom furniture and a spacious step up bathroom - looks like the room was freshly painted recently.  Quite cozy and my husband liked to open the windows (with screens) to enjoy the fresh air while we slept.  \n\nWe were on the 3rd floor and did hear a bit of noise with people loading and unloading at the front entrance but for the most part, it was very quiet and at night, not a creature was heard....I noticed that the West Tower is shut down - they are indeed renovating.  We had friends staying in the East Tower - all updated now and I believe the newest tower or extension to this venue in recent years - very nice, tile floors, new furnishings, etc.  But...we were quite happy in our little suite and I have no complaints - this time, there seemed to be less sounds of the pitter patter of feet which spoiled our stay in the West Tower in October. \n\nWhile the Lakeside Cafe has excellent service and probably the best breakfast buffet I have ever seen or had, it is indeed expensive, $16CDN is just too much when I can walk down to one of the cafe's about 2 blocks away and get a fabulous omelette, hashbrowns, toast or anything else for less than $10.  The hotel has a small coffee shop near the front entrance and they serve a breakfast sandwich with coffee for $4.95 - I didn't like it, a bit greasy.

Way too much for a buffet.   I would rather have paid for a room with pool access and gone out for breakfast and dinner (be served with better food) and pay less.  As for the room, the beds are hard for a \""resort\""  they do not use fitted sheets and the mattress cover they use is not the correct size and it bunches up.   we had 2 queen beds but with that the room is quite cramped for a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids under 12).   I was disappointed with the TV, a 42\"" flat screen with Analogue cable.  Not what i expected from a \""resort\"" for the price. The pools are nice, but for kids its a little boring.  There is no pool they can jump into, or a slide or a diving board.  there is a sign in the indoor pool that the pool is for \""relaxing\"" in.  the outdoor pool is only 5 feet deep and not jumping either.

Rooms are outdated and look just ugly, like highway motel ugly. The cleaning staff are doing a great job keeping this very old furniture and design look decent. \nOther than the pools, this hotel is not at all worth quarter the price.\n\nThe long version: I booked one night for my wife's birthday based on friends' recommendation, and when I got the reservation confirmation it was the first disappointment.\nSo the check in is at 4 pm! while checkout is the usual 11 am. We decided to try arriving early and see what happens, and were there at 2 pm. Apparently, they have a policy that starting 1 pm, if your room is ready they'll just check you in, if not, they'll guide you to the pool. Ok, so we got our room, which has an instant \""cheap motel\"" feel to it with a very obvious broken part of the bed, it's decorative, but still looks very obvious and is a bit sharp. The washroom sink has a huge crack in it, the bed wasnt comfy with a dozen of really really soft pillows, and the bed sheet wasnt even large enough to cover the entire bed. Everything in the room seem to have been around since the 60s. We were in the main tower so it might be the reason the rooms are that old. We changed, went to the pool and WOW, the hot spring water pool is just awesome, I've been in many hot springs around the world and it's the first time the water was that clean with no taste or odor (which made me doubt it's actually spring water) but it was just awesome. The kids pool was big enough for my 3.5 yrs old son to play or swim without us being worried he'd walk into any deeper parts.\nI'm surprised though that a hotel that full, that overpriced, old furniture, yet they cant afford to hire a lifeguard for some reason, so watch out if your kids are not good swimmers. Checkout was as rushed as check-in although it wasnt as busy.\n\nOverall, I might come again just for the pool, next time will try to book in the other towers or even get a day use -if that's an option- since it's only 1.5 hours drive from home. Will also look for other hotels in the area with similar pools and better rooms.",3,negative

We had an incredible 2 nights there.  We had booked the New Years Package which included dinner and dancing in the Copper Room with champagne at midnight and a New Years Champagne Brunch.  We had a beautiful room overlooking the lake in the West wing.  The room is not overly big but doesn't need to be.  Had a nice balcony which would be spectacular in the warmer weather.  A complimentary bottle of wine was waiting in our room when we arrived.  \nWe had early dinner at 6.30 with a fixed menu.  Experience in the past at other events such as this have proven to be mediocre at best.  however, our meals were terrific.  I had the lobster and langoustine dinner and my husband and the rest of our group had the tenderloin.  It was very good.  Our waiter and the kitchen where extremely accomadating to the person in our group who had several  allergies\u002Fsensitivities.  Our waiter was great (I can't remember his name) but he was very attentive.  The music covered all genres and and the band was good.  Unknown to us, our friend was proposing to his girlfriend that night and the band was accommodating to help him accomplish this.  My only complaint during the evening was when a waiter asked a family of children to stay off the dance floor.  I had already commented to their parents about how nice it was to see such well mannered children having a great time and was really surprised to see them being asked to leave.  The were very entertaining and extremely well-mannered and were bothering no one.  In fact they were very entertaining.  The grandmother told me that she had paid $150 for each child to be there and was quite upset that they were asked to leave the dance floor.\nWhen we returned to our rooms at about 1am, we stopped at our friends room to have a congratulatory drink with them.  The hotel had already put a chilled bottle of champagne in their room and a hand written note congratulating them on the their engagement, mentioning them both by name! Very nice touch!\nWe had an amazing brunch on New Years Day.  The buffet was probably once of the best I have ever had.  They had such a huge variety of things from king crab legs to roast beef and everything in between.  It was all amazing, especially for a buffet.\nThe hot springs were great too.

This hotel is in desperate need of a renovation. The beds are terribly uncomfortable and saggy. Interestingly enough, the hotel boasts of the \""renovated wing\"" for almost 2 decades. Time to actually renovate and stop deceiving people.\n\nThe restaurant, buffet and pool bar are great, over priced but typical for a seasonal business. \n\nThe spa uses a great product for skin treatments. The manicures\u002Fpecidures are relaxing but don't expect a great job like your local Vietnamese nail place. Here they didn't even push back my cuticles or cover my entire nail with polish. The services are over priced for a typical spa and the front lady Shanon is on autopilot. Don't expect a warm welcome from her. \n\nNow for the pools! These indoor and outdoor mineral pools are the only thing keeping this place in business. There is an adult only section that is quiet and peaceful. These pools are the only thing that keeps me coming back. \n\nFYI, if you are not a guest at the hotel, you must spend about $100\u002Fperson at the spa to use the pools. If you get any nail treatments, using the pool after will ruin them. If spa prices exceed the cost of their cheapest room, I'd opt just to get a room for the day.",3,negative

data\ca\154931\183786\351409713.html,Harrison Hot Springs Resort &amp; Spa,"""My friend suggested that we visit the hot springs since we live in BC and neither one of us have been there before. From word of mouth, we had heard good things about the hot springs, but I wish we had asked about the hotel itself. We found it to be very disappointing.\n\nWe had requested a king room overlooking the water. When we got to our room there was a small bed, overlooking the lower roof and vents. We immediately went back to reception and requested an alternate room. Being in the hotel and food & beverage industry, I cannot understand why they assigned that small room for 2 adults who requested a king room. Why not assign that room to a single traveller? Also, if there wasn\u2019t one available at the time, why not politely mention that to us before giving us our keycards to the smaller room?\n\nI would be polite if I described the hotel as \u201Cdated\u201D looking. I actually thought that it was a themed hotel because everything looked like something out of the sixties. Olivia Newton John, Barry Manilow and the Carpenters were playing over and over in the lobby area. I asked my friend if the hotel reminded him of anything in particular and he said the \u201CShining\u201D. Other guests overheard us and laughed because they said they had the same feeling!\n\n The rooms were clean and the bed was super comfy. The common areas were dirty looking and not well taken care of. i.e. empty tissue holders covered in a layer of dust in the lobby area ladies washroom. The dirty, worn out couch cushions.\n\nThe hot springs were crowded, but definitely relaxing.  When I got back my room I had the best nap ever!\n\nMy friend and I ate at the lounge in the lobby level. The beer and appetizer platter we had in the afternoon was good, but our dinner was a different story.  Since we both have to work in suits, we decided we didn\u2019t want to dress us on our day off and eat at the Copper Room. My friend\u2019s club sandwich was delicious and very fresh. I ordered salt and pepper wings for us to share, and Thai glass noodle salad for my main course.\n\nI was served 6 of the most disgusting chicken wings I\u2019ve every seen in my entire life. They didn\u2019t even look like chicken wings and had an odd taste. My noodle salad also tasted odd and cardboard-like and when I mentioned it to my server that those were not glass noodles on my plate, she didn\u2019t even know what glass noodles actually were. Definite lack of product knowledge!  It turned out that the kitchen decided to substitute the glass noodles with gluten free noodles.  I also returned the chicken wings and the server told me that they looked terrible because it was late (?) and that the cook had no explanation to why they looked that way since the oil is changed every day, and the wings are breaded every morning in Frank\u2019s Red Hot Sauce and flour. What disturbed us is that our server thought it was acceptable to bring that food out of the kitchen and serve it to us. \n\nAt that point we wondered why she was lying to us because we seriously doubted they changed the oil every day. It was also insane that she thought we would believe that they bread their wings in hot sauce and flour every morning. Why would anyone do that to wings that are offered in 4 flavours including salt & pepper? Quite insulting that she thought we were idiots. \n\nThis property seriously needs complete an overhaul. It seems mismanaged and the staff looks especially miserable to be working there. They seem like they\u2019ve been working there way too long and are just there to pick up a paycheck. The front desk staff (excluding bell sataff) were robotic and not warm and welcoming, the restaurant staff were pleasant but slow and forgetful.\n\n The staff lack the most basic customer service training. As I waited for my friend who was in the washroom on the lobby level, my attention was direct to the girl who was setting up the daily 4pm free tea and cookies station. She didn\u2019t smile or ask \u201Chow are you?\u201D, she just barked \u201Cnot until 4pm!\u201D and I hadn\u2019t even said one word to her! \n\nDo not go to the salon\u002Fspa! My friend wanted to get his hair trimmed which is what brought us to the salon\u002Fspa. When we entered, the staff member was texting and didn\u2019t acknowledge us until she finished her text and pressed \u201Csend\u201D. My friend asked me if I wanted to get a manicure, and the staff interrupted somewhat rudely that she doesn\u2019t do nails. She then went ahead and blabbed non-stop while she trimmed my friend\u2019s hair, with very inappropriate conversation. She told us that the lake was so dirty that she wouldn\u2019t even fart in it, and that she believes in humans with super powers because it can happen if they get hit by lightning! The staff member also had very bad body odor, and her phone kept notifying her of incoming texts. This goes back to staff being mis-managed or not managed at all!\n\nThis property could do so much better, but my impression is that they  don\u2019t care because they don\u2019t have to. They are always busy so why try harder? If a large hotel chain like the Westin would take it over it would be a first class facility. It has so much potential, and it\u2019s a shame to see it wasted.\n\nAs we drove away, my friend and I wondered how it could be so bad and rated so highly on Tripadvisor. It\u2019s probably because there are only 7 hotels in the area. I'm giving it one star only because the hot springs were relaxing and the bed was very comfortable.\n",1,negative

There is one shared bathroom, which is at the end rather than the middle, so some of us would have to walk across the others'  room to get to the bathroom in the dark at night.  Strange layout, but whatever, I can work with that.  \n\nWhat I could not believe was the noise that was coming through this room at night when we were trying to sleep at 10 or 11pm.  The room is at the worst possible location, right beside the entrance to the outside pool, with the door constantly banging and people talking loudly in the doorway and hallway.  The window in the room is useless as it offers no privacy, unless you want every guest to peep into your room on their way to\u002Ffrom the pools.  We kept it shut the whole time, which kept the room hot and stuffy because there's no A\u002FC (yes, I've been warned, so I won't complain)\n\nI gave this review two stars because ironically, the room is the shortest distance to the pool which means less freezing in the cold when you get out of the pool in your thin and cheap bathrobes.\n\nThis hotel is over-priced and over-rated, I feel that I did not get the value for my money.

As a bit of background my bride and I spent a few days of our honeymoon at the resort 50 years ago and thought, after hearing from a friend that the Copper Room, glass dance floor and live band nightly were still there, it would be a good place to celebrate our 50th anniversary with son and his wife and our daughter as well. After we booked and kept reading reviews I had some misgivings but what the heck, we were commited now.  \n\nFrom checkin March 11 to checkout March 14 it was fabulous.  Our anniversary is March 12 and they had it noted in their file (guess I'd told them enough times). We live in eastern BC and took couple of days to get to Harrison and arrived around 2 pm and our room, #7701, a Superior King in East Tower, was ready but kids' rooms were not. Kids were coming from the greater Vancouver area but had not arrived yet so no problem. We had no sooner walked away from reception and bell boy was there with his cart to take all our stuff to the room so we could park the car in their parking lot. When we arrived in our room it was definitely a \u201Cwow\u201D factor and clothes on hangers had been hung in closet by the bell boy (not really a boy). View of the lake was great, room was very clean, and bathroom had a humongous shower that was almost as large as our en suite bathroom at home.\nKids arrived about an hour later and their rooms, regular kings East Tower, were now ready. Checkin was smooth again as I made sure their rooms and any charges were to be on our credit card. They also had great views of the lake, maybe even better than ours, but our room was larger. Our son and wife were 2 doors away from us in 7703 and our daughter 2 floors down in 5503.\n\nWe were then off to pools to check them out. Great! And not too busy.  \nWe did not have plans for dinner but instead of wandering around the village looking for somewhere to eat we dined at Lakeside Cafe. There, you ordered your entree and helped yourself to the salad bar and dessert bar. It was good but not outstanding. \nMiss Margaret's was good in morning and lunch for coffee and light meal. It's a privately run Starbuck's.\nFamily ate in the Copper Room Saturday night, our anniversary, and food was fantastic. Their rack of lamb moved to #1 on my list. Wife and son had beef tenderloin, cooked to perfection medium rare, daughter had a chicken breast which was huge and d-i-l had a pasta dish. The band recognized our being their for our 50th and also that we had been there for our honeymoon. Kids went home Sunday afternoon so wife and I ate again in the Copper Room as we wanted to hear the other band. Both bands were excellent and played a wide variety of music for dancing. We both had the scallop and pork belly appetizer and we felt it was the best appetizer we'd ever had. Because there was so much food the night before my wife had another appetizer for dinner, avacado which also was great. I had the beef tenderloin which was like the night before cooked to perfection. Saturday night had over 300 reservations for dinner and Sunday only 80 so was much quieter and wait staff not rushed as much. \n\nCheckout Monday morning went smoothly with the lady in reception even warning me about the amount on the bottom of the statement and to take a deep breath before looking at it. Actually, it was within a couple hundred $ of what I had expected.\n\nLounging around the lobby, in fact playing a board game next to the fire place was a bonus. The funniest thing though of the weekend was watching what we called the polar bear parade (everybody in their white robes heading to or leaving the pools) especially when guests left the pools to get their free cup of tea and cookies in the afternoon.",5,positive

While the pools are a definite draw, and the hotel is usually fairly busy, I have noticed on our recent trip (1st time in about 3 years) that maintenance is taking a back seat with the hotel owners.  For the price that they charge for the original (old rooms with squeaky and slanted floors with no AC) rooms during Sunday to Thursday I would think they can spent more time and money at least maintaining the building and grounds. While in the pool you can see gutters that are falling off the roof, glass by the pools that are dirty (or etched with the sulphur water).  The lobby and entrance is dated and could use a remodel. My wife and I have not been coming as often as we used to because of the price of the rooms (it is expensive).\nWhen we arrived for our 2 night stay we were given wristbands that everyone was supposed to wear. We put them on as instructed (apparently too many people are sneaking in during tea and cookie time) but did not see many others with them on. While we were there we heard from one couple that they have been talking to a guy who comes into the pool everyday for about an hour and leaves his dog in the car. I think we saw this guy as well. Never did see any hotel staff in the pool area to enforce the wristband.\nAside from the building as such the check-in staff was wonderful.\nWe had a special that included breakfast at the hotel restaurant. It included about $20 towards a meal (the buffet was about that amount but tipping is extra). The food is nothing special, except the older man that makes your custom omelet - he is very good and entertaining.\nSo I rated the hotel, on its own, as average based on expense and the need of reno's. Overall because of the pools, it is definitely a draw and would bump it up to Good. \nIn my opinion, as more people start to see what is lacking and in need of maintenance, the owners may soon wonder why there are less people coming. This may cause them to lower prices but I hope they spend some money on maintenance.",3,negative

The hotel itself in the West Tower is in need of a little updating but the view and quiet from out room was not to be undersold.

The Bell Captain (Ralph?) was immediately on top of an issue with the Sandy Cove trail being shut off due to construction. The construction company had neglected to inform the hotel and the flag person was less than congenial. We lucked out with perfect weather and used all the hot pools which was really uplifting. Mid week is apparantly less busy so privacy and room are not so compromised. We had an outstanding couples massage with Yolande and ?. Beautiful, relaxing and very well-done. Meals in the Lakeside Terrace were very good for a buffet. Staff very attentive.  The Copper Room was excellent with the band, food and service.

They charge for parking, which I find pretty ridiculous considering the price you're paying to stay there, but oh well...onto our room.\n\nWe were assigned a room in the main hotel, which we understood to be the older part. We weren't looking for anything fancy. Our room itself was okay. Not very spacious, with furniture\u002Ffixtures in need of an update, but the bed was comfortable, and it was clean. Onto the bad...I am not exaggerating when I say that the noise level outside of our room was absolutely atrocious. From 8 am to after dark, we heard children (and adults) stampede down the hallway, yelling and screaming. It honestly sounded like our room was right outside of a playground. Every sound echoed on the hollow floors, and woke us up several times in the night, and made it near impossible to relax while reading or watching TV. I do understand it was Spring break for kids during our visit and the hotel was at capacity, but I still don't feel that's an excuse to let kids run wild through the hallways (especially unattended,) or have fully grown adults yelling and screaming at 1 am.The hotel most definitely needs to have staff throughout the hallways controlling these people. We came for a relaxing few days, if we wanted to pay to hear kids for 12 hours a day, we could have gone to Disneyland.\n\nOnto the food. I will say that the lounge was excellent, with delicious drinks and food, great service and helpful staff, and a very nice atmosphere (no kids allowed!) We grabbed a snack from Miss Margaret's one day as well, it was overpriced and our salad had a very disgusting dressing. We ordered room service once and weren't impressed. Room service opened at 4:30 and closed at 11, most hotels have way longer hours. They took forever to answer the phone\u002Freturn a voicemail, and the food was expensive and not worth the price. Wouldn't order again. My friend and I were pretty annoyed that it was impossible to get anything to eat after 11 - after the springs, it's easy to want for a snack, and we were told by the front desk that our only option was to eat from the vending machine...cookies for dinner it was. I will say the boxed lunch option from the front desk was good value and tasty. Thanks to the kind gentleman working at the lounge who let us know about this option - we wouldn't have known about it otherwise.\n\nNow for the reason we went in the first place - the hot springs. Upon entering the springs, my friend looked at each other and both commented that it resembled people soup. I realize we aren't the only clients at the hotel - but listening to twenty different conversations, children screaming, having someone's elbow in your face....hardly relaxing. We didn't bother with the all ages outdoor pools because it looked like a kiddie fun park, we spent most of our time in the adult only pool outdoors. This pool was a bit less crowded and less loud, but because of the proximity to the family pool, you still heard tons of shrieking children.The pool itself was alright. The water was clean and soothing to the skin, however the area around the pool left much to be desired, with gum stuck to the rocks and bandaids laying on the ground. Ew. More attention to cleanliness by staff would be very appreciated. The indoor springs were okay - a small hot tub and a cooler swimming pool. I found that the changing room was clean, and actually the most peaceful and quiet area in the entire resort - LOL!\n\nCan't comment on the spa as we didn't visit.\n\nOverall, I probably wouldn't go back unless the place got a massive overhaul and made it more catered towards adults - or had areas for adults only. I have no issue with kids at the resort if they are behaving well, but when the majority of parents let their kids run wild for days and annoy childless patrons while they ignored it and relaxed...that I do have an issue with. There are plenty of child centric vacation spots, the hot springs are for relaxing! Harrison itself is gorgeous, but there are way more upscale and well run vacation spots in the province for a similar price. I really wanted to love this place, but I didn't.",2,negative

There really is no reason for a resort of this caliber not to be putting its best foot forward with its greatest resource. And there is no reason why they can't have someone giving out towels poolside, or have a small mini-bar, at least for juices and softdrinks, right there. \n\nFurthermore, their second greatest resource is the view of the mountains over the lake. Why can't they set out lounges and tables out there beyond the parking?

Being local Vancouverites; and wanting a quick, weekend getaway - HHS seemed like a good option.  120km\u002F75 miles, from Vancouver, with the latter half of the drive offering some pretty stellar scenery.  (provided you select the Hwy 7 route, as opposed to Hwy 1)  \n\nWe assumed that April would be a little quieter than the summer period, and being that the \""Uncorked\"" Wine Festival was taking place this weekend - figured that the combination of Hot Springs Resort & Spa, and Wine Festival combined; sounded like a seemingly adult themed weekend.  WRONG!  Crawling with children; from infant to teen.  Before you jump on me with:  \""It's a \""family resort\"" you idiot!\""  I get that, but assumed that wouldn't be the case until the \""school's out\"" period between July and September.  Clearly - this is a kid-haven for summer.   What lake isn't?  My bad.  And, I digress!  This is meant to be about the hotel - not illbehaved rug-rats and absentee parents.  (not all - just some!)\n\nSo - Harrison is a pretty, charming lakeside town, with the valley being flanked by the Coastal Mountains.  The Hot Springs Hotel is considered the benchmark there and has been around forever with the original building now surrounded with new'ish construction.  We reserved (with a really nice agent) for an \""Executive Suite\"" in the West Tower which guarantees top floor, lake view with a queen or king bed.  Technically - they delivered, though I am not sure what was so \""Executive\"" about the room?  We don't mind paying 400 bucks a night for decent accommodation, but this was just average.  It was clean and comfortable, but nothing more.   By the way - if you're charging $400 \u002F night in April (or any time for that matter), please don't insult people by charging $3.50 for a small bottle of in-room Fiji water ... tacky.\n\nOverall; the common areas of the resort are well appointed, and well kept.  The pools themselves are well laid out, nicely designed and well kept, but are small and  ill-equipped to accommodate a full house.  We decided to wait until the evening when \""adult hours\""  were in effect to visit the pools.  Sadly - those hours are neither respected, adhered to by guests, or enforced by the resort.   One pool was clearly adult, but was also beyond capacity, and was really loud.  Kind of a boozed-fueled-human stew.  Not a pretty site!  Early the next morning - I took a coffee down to the pool area.  Not a soul!  Just me and the pool maintenance person.  So beautiful - so quiet!  Just the sound of birds and the peaceful morning effect of steam rising from the water.  As luck would have it - the pools were closed for maintenance, and I couldn't take advantage.  Of course we did not expect to have entire pools to ourselves, but also did not expect what we experienced.  One thing that did make us laugh ... during \""adult hours\"" - we did go to one of the outdoor pools for a while, and it was ok.  As it continued to fill - we headed for the indoor pool.  There's a sign mounted there that says something to the effect of:  \""This pool is intended for relaxation, reflection and calm.  No jumping, shouting, splashing, etc. will be tolerated.\""  (Not a direct quote but you get the idea)  Really?  Tell that to the kid who just did a running front-flip off the side of the pool to scare his sister, while his parents were engaged in really loud conversation with another couple.  All the while - sipping cocktails out of their plastic cups in the pool.  Or - the little girl who was intent of slapping an oversized beachball around.  Just take the sign down already!\n\nSo - this is very much a \""live-and-learn\"" review.  We can't knock HHSRS for this experience.  The location is beautiful, the town is charming, the resort is decent and the staff are friendly.  There are an abundance of things to do outdoors, and it definitely has a family-travelers audience.  For us - we'd be more likely to take out-of-town guests on a day trip to Harrison.  Have lunch - take a stroll around and head home.\n\nCouple of dining tips:  If you want to go to one of the more \""upscale\"" restaurants for dinner - make a reservation.  We were turned away from 3 empty one's with \""Reserved\"" signs on the tables.  If you're looking for a decent breakfast - the buffet inside HHSHR (Lakeside Cafe) is good food, good value and great staff.\n\nLastly; I clicked \""yes\"" to:  \""Does this hotel have a golf course?\""  It's not on site, but only a short distance away.\n\nEnjoy - KDM",3,negative

We travelled as a family of 4, 2 adults and 2 kids. With kids who are in different age groups, it is essential for us to have 2 separate rooms. The family suite in the main part of the hotel is great-it has two separate bedrooms which each have tvs, and doors that close to each one, with the bathroom in a hall in the middle. Great!\nExcept we found out perhaps why the family suite is a great deal-the walls are paper thin in the main hotel. Our neighbours on one side of the suite stayed up late every night talking, and they had a dog who barked (not often, but still). We could hear every word they said, basically. One side was ok, the first night it sounded like there was a couple staying there but they went to bed early. The second night the room was empty. We didn't feel like we should complain to the front desk about the people next door, they were, after all, just talking, not partying or being loud. The thin walls are definitely not hotel management's fault-but we'll know for next time.\nAlso, I had an issue with my reservation-and I couldn't seem to get the right answer from the reservations people on the phone (also once spent 20 minutes on hold!!!), so I just decided to correct it at the desk. They took care of it when I checked out (I was overcharged), which was great.

We booked via internet and it all went smoothly.  Check in was slow, took about 30 mins.  We stayed in the older part of the hotel on the ground floor. No view and we were overlooking the walkway to the hot pools.  Which was fine for us as we spent little time in our room during the day because the pools were so awesome.  First let me say the room was nicely furnished and renovated.  Bathroom small but nicely done.  Bedroom lovely with some interesting retro type furniture.  Our room had no air conditioning but the weather was on the cool side when we were there so this not a problem to me.  The hotel does charge 5.00 to rent a robe in this area which who cares about the 5.00 but I thought should be included as this is not a cheap hotel.  The pools are awesome especially the outdoor hot pool that was adult only.  Although there were a couple of kids in there they were the types you don't really notice because they were quiet and well behaved.  The family pool was noisy and busy, the lap pool out of doors was nice.  The grounds are really lovely.  We never ate there as it was really pricey and we heard from others we talked to there it was not very good.  There are plenty of small restaurants in the area and I would suggest you try them out.  We were there during the Harrsion Festival and there was many things to see and great music in the park all for free.  The area is stunningly beautiful.

There was a table with a coffee pot on it...that we had to move 4 feet over because the cord didn't reach the plug. There was mould in the tub. All the rooms in the old section smell of old rotted wood. My daughter, the bride, had a room in a newer wing. The room was nice and the shower would fit probably 8 people. But the water pressure wasn't there. It took her forever to rinse the shampoo from her hair. This wedding pumped thousands of dollars into that hotel, both with the wedding, guests that booked rooms, guests that ate meals and hit the bar. Yet the bride and groom did not get a deal on their room. I heard from other guests who booked at hotels down the street that were less expensive and way nicer. Don't do it!!",3,negative

Such thoughtfulness & kindness that we so much appreciated.

I do not work for the resort nor do I know anyone that does). We booked the East Tower - room 8815.  We found our room to be very comfortable - 6 foot tub and shower in a large modern bathroom, bar fridge, view of the lake, AC, micro fiber robes  (no extra fee) and two queen size beds.  I wanted to be on the top floor (away from any street, pool noise).  This was to be a romantic getaway for my husband and I.  We liked the idea that the resort has 'adult only' areas.  My only advice would be maybe a couple of 'adult only' floors, so couples without kids don't have to  listen to other peoples\u2019 kids running around the halls at night, or trying to come into our room because they are lost.  This resort caters to families so there are a lot of kids around.  Our check-in experience was great.  We were checked-in by Sarah who checked us in quickly and efficiently.  We enjoyed the afternoon tea the resort provides everyday at 4pm (line up early) Our dinner at the Copper Room was fantastic (we both ordered the salmon - it was perfect), and the excellent band made our evening very special.  The hot spring pools are of course the best part of this resort.  There are five pools in total (3 adult only).  We spent all our time in the 'adult only' outdoor pool which was quiet, relaxing (only a couple of times did parents bring their kids in)  and exactly what we were looking forward to.  \n\nI would highly recommend this hotel.

The tour guide handled registration which went smoothly enough considering there were 40+, many infirm elderly on our bus. \n\nOur room was comfortable, clean, adequately appointed, small by today\u2019s standards, but it faced an inner roof, the mountains peeking above, the recently renovated bathroom was cramped, the floor measuring about 3\u2019 x 7\u2019,  and an exhaust fan ran continually. The newer additions were larger and doubtless more expensive. Traversing the confusing layout reminded us of Agatha Christie cum The Shining.

A complaint promptly brought the maintenance man who found the valve had mysteriously been turned almost off. The first night our tour had a fixed dinner in the Copper Room, routine group cooking. \n\nExcellent huge breakfast, all you can eat, wide selection that should please all.\n\nThe raison d\u2019\u00EAtre for the resort are the hot springs, three outdoors - the largest mainly for families, , two within a small building. We didn\u2019t use the interior pools finding the stench of chlorine in the hot atmosphere overpowering. The outdoor pools were pleasant if you are fortunate enough to get to them before the crowds and when the weather\u2019s not too cold. A good size lap pool, the lanes unmarked. Recreational users wander The large addition translates into more bodies wanting to use the finite pools. \n\nA lovely setting on a long mountain encircled lake marred by gaudy water play equipment sitting empty and an ugly dock. The hot water source is a third mile along the lake in an enclosed building from which steam issues.

It is the sort of place where you go for a jog and then eat gelato - relaxing!  It is a bit breezy or even windy at times but the sun keeps you warm as long as you are in it.\n\nThe Harrison resort seems like it has seen better days though.  I do not know what has happened.  As I state above all the amenities and facilities are in place but the service and follow through are not.\n\nMy room smelled of pee and had tattered carpet.\n\nThe bed skirt was ripped and tattered.\n\nWhen we arrived at around 12pm we were told our room might be ready in 1.5 hours.  When we returned at 4pm both rooms still weren't ready.  Finally we got into one room and an hour later into the second room.  But in the meantime every time you want to check in or discuss an issue with the front desk you have to stand in a lineup that is often 45 minutes long!  I am accustomed to being checked in right away not having to stand in a lineup between ropes!  Even once they have dealt with you and given you bad service (ie, not having your room ready repeatedly) you still have to get back into that long lineup if you have any other questions.  In fact there is no way to call the front desk from the room, you can only call customer services and they will suggest you go stand in the lineup at the front desk to get your question asked because they inevitably do not know the answer.  When we asked why our rooms were late the answer was that the people in the rooms the night before had checked out late - not acceptable in my opinion.\n\nWe also paid extra to request an extra cot in the room.  This was not in the room upon our arrival and we had to call and lineup repeatedly before they brought it.  When they did bring it they did not set it up but rather just rolled it in and left it in the middle of the room.\n\nThere are no towels available at the pool area of their extensive pool network (5 pools) and no instructions in you room reminding you\u002Ftelling you to take your towels down with you.  I went downstairs expecting a normal poolside service and could not find one!  Not only that but i asked different employees repeatedly and they kept telling me they did not know the answer!  So I wandered around for about 20 minutes before someone told me  I had to go get towels from my room.\n\nThere is also no poolside bar or food service.  They do have a bar which you can order overpriced drinks from if you walk up to ask yourself and a bbq for getting a limited menu of food.  But there is nobody to take your order or deliver it or clear your dishes.  Also all drinks come in dinky plastic cups not classy poolside cocktail glasses.\n\nThe result of these shortcomings is that the poolside is a mess with garbage drifting around seeing as nobody is actually maintaining the situation.  There is also nobody to help you get poolchairs and there is a severe shortage of poolchairs compared to the number of guests.  I had to put my book down on top of my shoes in the dirt as there are not any places to put your things if you have not gotten one of the chairs for yourself.\n\nThere are 5 pools.  One of these is adults only.  When I was there there were children in the adults only pool.  There is also adults only times in the outdoor pools but when I was there there were children in the pools during the adult only late-night hours - playing marco polo and making it hard to both relax in the pools and subsequently to get to sleep in my room.\n\nThis is a very family-oriented place so don't really expect peace and quiet anywhere.  If yelling and crying children is the ambience you prefer then you are in luck.\n\nThere are also locks everywhere which rather than giving the resort an \""exclusive\"" feel makes you feel like you are on limited access even as a guest.  I later talked to a local who explained to me that all locals stock their bathrooms with towels from the hotel and sneak in regularly to use the pools so I guess the security is necessary but you can not go anywhere without a key.  Even if you want to go to the bar in the evening for a drink with friends they will not be able to use the bathroom in the lobby without a key.  I think if the hotel put some more greeters at the door they might do a better job at keeping unwanted people out than by locking every door.\n\nOh yes - there is limited greeting at the door and apparently no bellman service to deliver your bags from your car to your room - or at least none was offered when we arrived.\n\nThe Lonely Planet reports that this hotel has a slick business-hotel-like decorating job.  This is true but it is surface deep and cheap.  \n\nReally as a British Columbian myself I found this to be such a disappointment because the resort COULD be so fantastic - yet it isn't.  It is not a destination for \""beautiful people\"" but rather a family-oriented noisy sub-standard-service sort of place.

We were put in room 258 right above the adult pool where noise went from 9:00 AM until 11:00 PM. The noise \""was in the room\"" even with the slider closed. We found ourselves staying up until 11:00 PM so we could go to sleep when the pool closed - sort of. Not a good way to relax !!!\n\nWe also purchased the package which included a dinner in the Copper Room. Our experience there was no better. The service dragged on forever. On top of that the food was just adequate to say the very least.

Staff in the hotel were nice and friendly. The breakfast buffet place attached was incredibly overpriced. \n\nThe town honestly felt like a run down Blackpool.

Its a dirty poorly decorated nightmare that stinks like someone died in the hallways and rooms. For the $160 per night they charge its absolutely a rip off. \n\nLets start with check in. Poorly organized all around. First room given stunk so bad that had to insist a room change. Of course they have no more room but will move the next night. No one wants to be moving around when they are supposed to be relaxing. What is that smell? Its not quite mold but very pungent and very stale. Like someone has been smoking in room for 40 years then died and left for a few weeks. No kidding.\n\nSecond room stinks too but not as bad. Still troublesome as its not comfortable to walk in your room and BAM get hit in the face with stink. Reading other reviews this seems to be the entire hotel. Couldnt escape the stink in the halls. Speaking of the halls this place is the weirdest setup. THeres levels within the floors. You go down a hall up a few steps then around a corner and step down a few steps. Its like they joined several building together that were not level. The walls and carpets look very \""trailer\"". THe rooms also have a \""mobile\"" feel. Very cheaply done in the worst granny floral prints. Many hotels use ugly themes but this one takes the cake for ugliest decor and overall crap finishings. Bathtub\u002Fshower enclosure was one of the cheap plastic all in one units. Buthtub was stained. Overall the bathroom was clean though.\n\nOk enough about the bad stinking rooms. Lets get onto the real let down. THis place is supposed to be home to the hot springs so I excitedly go to the pool area to get me into a nice hot mineral bath. Well, theres some man made pools that reek of chlorine but where are the natural hotsprings? I search and search but cannot find. Finally I ask. \""There they are\"" .... the man made pools. The hotel claims to pipe the water in from the actual hot springs which are up some mountain nearby. So the hot springs arent really hot springs at all but standard hot tubs. They heat to 98 degrees no hotter. Does the water really come from the REAL hot springs? I dunno, I could find no evidence of water coming in in any way other then any other hot tub. What a let down. Its very normal hot tub and pool setup. No actual hot springs here. Isnt this false advertising?\n\nFood in the hotel is expensive. Its also horrible. I would compare it to a decent hospital cafeteria but served at big prices. This place is all about the captive audience. \n\nIn short the place is a dump and not worth the prices. I'll never be back EVER. They could cut the price in half and I'd still say never again. As an extra warning they charge for everything you do. Want a robe for the \""hot springs\""? No problem they'll charge you $5 per day rental for it though. They also charge you $4 per day to park your car. THeres nothing but space at Harrison and they dont mention it until you get there. Nickel and dime foolishness in my opinion. Using the telephone is also an adventure. Anywhere you call is long distance and you have to go thru a big process seting up your billing just to use the phone. This hotel is one joke after the next.\n\nThe maids were nice. The soap the hotel uses is nice. Those are the only two plus's. What a dissapointing experience this hotel was. Just plain poor. I washed everything I had with me soon as I got home as I was worried about that stink getting into everything. God I'll never forget that.

We used to love it there and went back after being away for a long time and were surprised by how much has changed since. The first thing you notice is the massive floating kids waterpark that sits in the water in front of the hotel, which obstructs what was once an amazing view of the lake and mountains. Also, the whole village smelled like manure, likely from the surrounding farms. I get the hotel can't likely control this, but it was really noticeable outside. Inside th hotel, the place has not been updated at all, which means it looks ten years older, dated and worn. It was shocking to see how much it was the same as when we were there ten years ago. It was as though no money had been put into updating the place at all. The carpets were filthy and worn, and the same as before. Even the weight room had all the same old dated stuff. One thing we noticed that had changed was the bathrobes. Once thick and luxurious, they are now cheap thin.\n\nThe real shock came when visiting the pools. They were completely overrun with kids and toys, many unsupervised, jumping in the pools and splashing everyone, breaking the rules, and causing disturbances and noise for the other guests. And this went on until 10pm outside and 11:30 PM inside the pools. The last time were there, the adult only time was after 9. I like kids, but it was a sunrise to sunset gong show there of screaming kids. Some families also claimed large sections of beach chairs on the deck all day, and by days end, we're covered with garbage and wet towels. It looked like a pigsty in parts. My personal favorite moment of the day was looking over my shoulder to see a dirty wet diaper left sitting on the pool deck. \n\nThere also was a group of boaters staying there that also caused a lot of disruption for the other guests. They were drinking beer from coolers outside on the beach in front of the hotel all afternoon - which was trashy in itself to witness - but they came into the pools after dark, where the fun continued. The highlight was seeing a rather obese drunk woman lifting her top off to show her breasts to her male friends in the adult pool, not once but many times, and smothering the men's faces between them. They were so drunk, having been drinking poolside in open view all evening with their own liquor from solo cups. The hotel security did nothing even though other guests complained. Nice.\n\nHarrison used to be our favorite hotel for a relaxing time. No longer. This place has become a kids waterpark aimed at drawing large families.

This for me was nice because we didn't have to eat at the hotel for every meal. There were so many options within walking distance.\n\nOne of the best things about this hotel specifically though is their 5 hot springs pool. There is an adult only pool, a family \""play\"" pool, a pool that resembles more of a lap pool, an indoor pool, and an indoor hot tub - all varying in water temperature. The family \""play\"" pool is quite warm which is perfect for little kids and for swimming after sunset - a huge selling feature. Sure it was busy but it was also a weekend, in August. On the pool deck between 4-4:30, they also serve afternoon tea which included hot or cold tea and cookies\u002Fsnacks. The staff serve you which I prefer for hygienic reasons. \n\nMost of us stayed in rooms in the East tower and I thought the rooms were great. It had a small balcony with a side view of the mountains and beach which was perfect for enjoying your Starbucks coffee in the morning (available in the lobby - not a true Starbucks but serves Starbucks coffee). The rooms were clean and very spacious equipped with a mini fridge and free wifi. Bathrooms have lots of counter space, each bed had a bench at the foot of it for sitting or placing things and each room had a little table with two sitting chairs. We had also rented a suite for one night to allow family to gather and it was perfect for the number of people we had. Saved us from having to rent a meeting room which would have been excessive.\n\nSome cons to mention, although not a show stopper:\n1) As a beach resort, they need to have better hair dryers than those dinky wall mounted conair hair dryers. Sometimes little things can go a long ways and for me, that was a sign of be outdated considering a decent hair dryer these days doesn't cost that much.\n2) No safes in the room - again, would be nice to be able to lock up your valuables. Especially since no ones going to be taking valuables with them to the beach or pool\n3) Pool towels - would be nice if they offered pool towels instead of having to bring your room towels down. A) would be way easier and B) towels would keep better so that they're not stained with sunscreen and I'm assuming food.

On our first night there, the smoke detector went off SIX times around 1am.  A maintenance man had to come and replace it in the middle of the night.  Not exactly the kind of thing you want on your engagement night.  The maintenance guy informed us that this kind of thing happens 'all the time' in this hotel.   Not very comforting at all. \n\nWhen we went down to the front desk in the morning, we spoke to the very rude Front Office Manager, Peter.  We explained him what had happened and his response was, \""Look, I'm a straight shooter.  Why don't you just tell me what you want?\""  \nThere was no apology, nothing.  We asked if he could remove some, if not all the charges for the night before and he just laughed.  After chatting for several minutes, he finally agreed to give us a gift certificate for a one-night stay in the future.   He promised us that it would be available at the front desk for us upon check out.  \n\nWhen we checked out on the last day, it turned out that he had completely forgotten about the gift certificate.  There was no record of it on our file.  So we had to speak with him all over again and he said it would be sent to us in the mail.  \n\nHe was the rudest manager that I have ever come into contact with in the hotel industry.\nWe would have been happy with a simple apology from him about our 1am interruption.

It is crazy busy in August, people and kids everywhere. The hotel is as its been for many years now. We were disappointed that the Jones Boys were not playing and so we did not dine in the Copper Room, usually one of our favourite activities.\nI must mention the AC in the East Tower. Our AC was either an Arctic Hurricane or Arctic Strong wind. It was not possible to have a low fan setting even though it said low. If one even nudges the thermostat off the low end by one degree it immediately blew hot air at the same velocity. The response of the desk was that this is just the way it is.

All pools are open to hotel guests as part of their stay and will receive wristbands upon check-in. A day pass to the pools may be purchased if staying elsewhere. The resort is located across the street for Harrison Lake (this is a glacier fed lake, so be prepared for the cold water temperature). The lake is definitely a contrast to the hot pools at the hotel. The Resort hot spring pools range in temperature from 28C(83F) to 40C (104F). There are 2 indoor pools, 2 outdoor pools, & 1 adult only pool. While we were there, 4:00pm was Tea Time. Guests were offered their choice of hot or cold complimentary tea & cookies.  (a nice mid-afternoon energy boost).  The pool area has some tables with umbrellas in addition to lounge chairs positioned around the pools.The Family pool offers entry via stairs or a gentle walk-in. \nThe only criticism regarding the pools would be that guests come down early in the morning & throw towels on the chairs and then are never seen again. We saw some pool lounge chairs never occupied for the whole day. The hotel should monitor this behavior and after a certain length of time, remove the towels so other guests can sit down. \n\nWe were in a family room \u2013 2 bdrms & 1 bathroom. Since this is the oldest wing of the hotel, there is a ceiling fan and a tower fan in place of air conditioning. The windows do open, and the room cooled down sufficiently in order to be able to sleep at night. \nThere is handicap access to the pool floor. There are also plenty of washrooms\u002Fchange rooms located around the pool area. If you are a hotel guest, robes are provided for going to & fro the pool or spa. Parking for hotel guests is located at the back of the resort. It is a bit of walk, so pack light. Staying at the resort is a lovely getaway regardless of time of year.

data\ca\154931\183786\4129965.html,Harrison Hot Springs Resort &amp; Spa,"""My husband and I went to Harrison Hot Springs \""Resort & Spa\"" this weekend and it was anything but a resort -- this was a crappy hotel with crappy service who nickled and dimed us on everything we wanted to do. \n\nThis review could go on and on and on about all the terrible service we received but two things really stuck out for us. \n\n1. They charge only some guests $5 per bathrobe if you want to use one to go down to the hot springs -- other guests don't pay for bathrobes. For a \""resort\"" that claims to be all about the hot springs destination, nickling and diming me on a bloody bathrobe is ridiculous. The worst part is they dont' charge all guests, they only charge guests who stay in the main hotel. If you stay in the East or West tower the robes are free. When asked for an explanation why we'd pay when other guests weren't, the manager told us it was because our room hadn't been renovated yet. As if to say that somehow our bathrobes weren't just sitting on a shelf while we didn't use them, because our room wasn't renovated. The point is they nickle and dime you on everything -- parking is $4\u002Fday, bathrobes are $5\u002Frobe, late checkout is $40, etc etc.\n\n2. The service was horrific. For $199\u002Fnight and a $118 dinner, it was complete crap. When we weren't happy with our room because it was utterly charmless and frankly unappealing, the manager told us we couldn't switch rooms unless we paid an extra $40\u002Fnight -- for a smaller room with no view (we had a view of the pools from our current room). When we got into a lengthy discussion about how it was 10pm and the room wasn't going to be filled anyway, and maybe they should just make the guests who are already there happy, they told us they couldn't do it because we were on a gift certificate. As if to say that because half our bill was being footed by our friends (a wedding gift), it wasn't real money so we were second class citizens. They didn't offer us complimentary robes, free parking, or anything to make this up to us. Instead they offered that they would refund our friends' gift certificate if we wanted to leave -- we were pretty much given the choice of insulting our friends by not staying, or staying in a room we didnt like in a hotel who knew nothing about good service. The next day the Regional Manager offered to comp our late checkout if we wanted to stay an extra couple hours -- they charge $40!!!! if you want to stay past 11am. So a day late, he was willing to comp the $40 for late checkout -- in a place we no longer wanted to be he wanted us to stay longer, but he wasn't willing to comp the room we wanted which was smaller and had no view, and according to the front desk was open for the weekend. And last, we waited 2 hours for our dinner. We got our soups in 5 minutes, and 2 hours later, with no waiter around to refill our wine glasses or offer us another bottle, we still had no meal.\n\nI would never ever recommend Harrison Hot Springs Resort & Spa. Ever. Or any hotel owned by Delaware North Companies Parks and Resorts -- if they all think customer service is what this place thought it was, you're setting yourself up for pure disappointment and a joke of an attempt at customer service. I've never stayed in a hotel for $200\u002Fnight and not been treated like a queen -- I've paid 80\u002Fnight and been treated better and had a nicer room.\n\nIf you're thinking about staying there, don't.

This is a bit of a nostalgic experience, don't expect air-conditioning but there are plenty of fans and the room is well maintained, though the style is old. Our room had a view on nothing, which was a bit of a disappointment, but most of the time we were at the polls anyway, or sleeping. \n\nThe pools is the reason to go to this place of course. We are very fond of onsens in Japan, and this is the first place outside of Japan that gives me a bit of that feeling. Yes, it is still very different, but the water temperature, the magnificent views on the forest and mountain from the pools, the big stores besides the pools and the converted wooden walkway all contribute to the Japanese feeling. What is missing, is the smell. \n\nOne major drawback, certainty when considering this is a natural hot spring, is the fact that much chlorine is added to the water. Inconceivable at a Japanese hot spring where one would enjoy the distinct smell of the hot spring. But this is Northern America so I presume one is afraid of germs etc., making the usage of true spring water probably pointless. Anyway, the result is you smell of chlorine for the days to come unless you thoroughly scrub after each bath, which is quite the opposite of what is good for your skin. As a result : itchy skin... Despite this disappointment, we thoroughly enjoyed the place!

The wallpaper was lifting off the wall, the carpet was lifting off in the middle of the room and rippling, the bathtub had rust in the bottom of it, the king size bed was hard and every spring was felt and the furniture and room need a major renovation. \nWe have stayed in the west tower once before during our first visit and the room was facing poolside then and on the 4th floor but was a lot nicer then (6 years ago) and the other visits we always stayed in the east tower which was better with decor and the beds much softer and the bathroom a good size. This room we stayed in was on the 2nd floor and lakeside but it wasn't impressive at all as mentioned above. However, the housekeeping staff are excellent and do their best. \nAnother issue we had was the pool area was constantly messy with people's drink and food garbage. Items that had been placed around the pool in the morning by other guests was still there in the evening at closing. There were overly drunk people in the pools at night and were acting completely inappropriate and there were kids jumping from the top of the waterfall disrupting many guests.

They told me I couldn't pay cash for the room and then argued with me when I said \""I always pay cash and put a credit card down for additional charges\""\n\nLeft my room at 7am, went back at 3pm and it still was not cleaned.

Stayed with my husband for the getaway package.  I would have been disappointed if we hadn't selected a room with the lake view( we had west tower king with lake view) the room was clean with a comfortable bed, everything worked well but the furniture is old, the carpet had a few cigarette burn holes and the bathroom door was very chipped and worn-  bathtub had rust stains etc.  The view did a lot to compensate for the decor.  Also, if you need a firm pillow- bring your own. \n     The pools are nice, enjoyed the hotter adults only pool. \nWe did not realize that you could have drinks at the pool-  The\"" Pool Bar\"" opens in the evening when the Copper Room is open- I thought the take out window was  quite funny... but good.\n\nThe breakfast buffet is good-but the coffee was horrible- We got our caffeine fix from Miss Margaret's coffee bar afterwards,\nThe Islands Bar is great- good drinks and food, excellent service.\nThe Copper room - found this disappointing and confusing,  Is it fine dining, swing dancing, cocktail lounge or disco?? There was a large party of bridge players (110) of them dining when we were there for a romantic dinner.  NOT romantic ... If you are supposedly enjoying a classy meal why would you enjoy a loud bunch shouting out to \""Tequila\"" etc.  Maybe the dancing should be later in the evening??\nFood was good.\nOverall the entire experience was quirky- there are some lovey elements here, beautiful setting, some unique decor- loved the upper lobby( but why a giant stuffed RCMP bear?)   \nI would come again because the charm outweighs the negative bits.

Once was on a Sunday evening of a regular weekend and once was on a Friday evening of a holiday weekend.  This is a family friendly establishment but if you are looking for peace and serenity, avoid a long weekend.  All the families looked happy and engaged but people blatantly disregarded the signs for not diving, jumping, yelling, screaming, and behaviour contrary to the purpose of one of the indoor pools which was labelled on a sign as being for relaxation and reflection.  This has nothing to do with the resort and everything to do with the parents and children not feeling obligated to respect others around them and the signs posted.  Now, on that stated Sunday evening, the experience was divine.  It was quiet in all five pools and there were only a few families and the children were respectful.  The five pools are inviting and soothing.  We were in the pools for hours in the evening and hours the next day prior to departure.  We experienced a service in the spa and the staff were wonderful.  We had breakfast buffet in the cafe and the variety of food was more than enough to make everyone happy.  The quality of the food was high and the omelette maker was in top form satisfying individual desires.  Our rooms (both times) were well appointed and the robes and towels were comfy and cozy.  I don't think anyone could be disappointed in a stay at the resort or a service at the spa.  The staff are well trained to make your stay enjoyable.  We treated ourselves to the valet parking and that was totally worth it.  This is a wonderful destination with lots to do, all outlined on the website.  We went for the pools.  Amazing.

Check in was easy and welcoming.  Our room on the fourth floor in the west tower overlooking the pools was great.  The house cleaning staff were great workers and did a wonderful job in a timely manner each day.  The buffet breakfast each morning was also very good.  \n\nOur issue with this getaway was more to do with other guests and children but the hotel must take a significant portion of responsibility because they did not do anything about it.  As unbelievable as it sounds there were parents taking their babies into the indoor hot pool and not having them suitably protected from pooping or peeing in the pool(s).  We are talking babies with no control of their bodily functions.  At one point there were two with unsuitable diapers, wet from the pool water and hanging to their knees, incapable of stopping any leakage of waste.  We did not see any leaks  happen but sat in the pool horrified just waiting for the disaster which would require the closing of the pool to drain and clean it.  At one point there was one totally naked baby. There was also a young family with a baby and a couple of small children.  There was no problem with diapers here but the mom had brought in food for the family.  She was hand feeding crumbly bars of some kind and a box of french fries and ketchup to her children, husband and another adult female who were sitting IN the indoor hot tub. Others were eating on the indoor pool deck around the tub which is still unacceptable. The children factor was actually worse than what I have written so far but you get the picture.  (I should say that there were many more children at the resort than we have ever seen there before. It seemed like zillions.) \n\nI was not positive what the hotel rules were so prior to going back to our room I inquired at the front desk.  I was told all the above was against the rules.  The desk staff apologized and said they would advise staff to keep an eye out for this behavior.  The staff commented that they too were surprised by the number of children currently at the resort.\nIt appears the message was not passed on because in the evening of the same day we were back in the pools and at the indoor one the same behaviors were present with the exception of food.  This had a tremendously negative impact on our stay.  I don't want to return to the resort because of it.  My wife says give it time and maybe we will try again.  We have been going to this resort for decades and have loved it.  We live on Vancouver Island so getting there is expensive.  It is unfortunate that on this trip I feel the money was wasted and that management did not take our concerns about the lack of respect shown by some guests\u002Fparents towards the rest of the guests seriously enough to take any steps to correct it.  My wife says we may go back.  Right now I am a firm NO WAY.  There are lots of places to spend our vacation dollars that will be more in keeping with relaxation than the last three days at this resort were.  I feel bad giving these negative comments about a resort we have visited many times but these are the things travelers want to know about before committing their holiday time and money.  I understand the hotel is under new ownership but I do not know if that had any bearing on the issues we observed.",4,positive

The water is incredible and really does soothe all your aches and pains\u2026\n\nUnfortunately, beyond the pools and the spa, the resort experience really drops off. What could and likely should be a truly relaxing getaway is mired by loud kids and aging hotel infrastructure.\n\nIf you're unlucky and happen to be assigned to the original hotel building, it's unbelieveably noisy. Walls are paper thin, and your woken up by very loud creaking floors up above. The building was built in the 20's and it's long overdue from some serious structural upgrades.

There's a water park area out back that really should be redeveloped into a kids\u002Ffamily friendly pool area that can be used year round so the indoor spa pools can be places where couples can relax and unwind.\n\nIf you can tune out the noise and soak up the incredible spring water, then you'll have a good time.

In the past we've enjoyed a relatively quiet time there. In recent years we have found the hotel to be getting busier and busier during this promotion. Our first experience of the chaos was when we poorly timed our vacation to coincide with a union group's annual convention. We've been at the hotel twice now when that same group is there. It feels a bit like being the odd man out.\n\nWe typically have stayed over a Tuesday\u002FWednesday but this last trip was a Sunday\u002FMonday trip. No union folks this time, but many families. We wondered if families took advantage and stayed Sunday\u002FMonday so that they only needed to take their kids out of school for one day instead of two. That could explain why we've often been there mid-week and not seen many kids at all. \n\nThis latest trip was insane. We found the pools crowded on the Sunday afternoon when we arrived. When we tried to return after dinner it was a human soup down there. And kids were cannonballing and screaming around in the indoor pool which is supposedly for \""quiet reflection\"". I really wish the hotel would make these indoor pools adult only or adult only for more hours than the currently do.\n\nMonday morning I returned to the pools at 7:30 and enjoyed some solitude which didn't last long. It's hard to find time for \""quiet reflection\"" when toddlers are around. :\u002F\n\nIt was encouraging to see the outdoor pools being cleaned at 7:30am Monday morning especially after seeing how many people had been stewing in them the night before. But housekeeping didn't appear to have made it to the women's washroom by the time the indoor pools had opened. After answering nature's call, I realized there was no toilet paper. Without going into too much detail, I'll just say that I'm glad no one was around as I exited the one and only toilet stall without my bathing suit bottoms in order locate a suitable substitute for toilet paper. It makes me wonder how many people before me found the toilet roll empty, shrugged it off and jumped in the pools anyway. Awesome. \n\nI found the staff on this trip to be lacklustre. In the past I've encountered smiling faces and friendliness from all staff. This time, it felt like staff were feeling overworked or overwhelmed. The tea and cookies ladies looked downright miserable. The kid bringing clean dishes up to the Lakeside for the breakfast buffet had no social skills. The front desk also continues to ask if we've visited before. I've worked in a hotel before so I know there's a way of recording in the guest files who is a repeat visitor. It's a small thing but it really irks me. If my business means anything to you, you'll record somewhere in your system that I've visited you eight times and when I go to check in you'll say, \""Welcome back\"" instead of, \""Have you stayed with us before?\""\n\nEven though this visit was very much a \""poor\"" on the scale of 1 to 5, I'm giving it an \""average\"". I feel like the service is slipping, but maybe we just caught a bad couple of days. \n\nRoom service was awesome. We had a great experience with the waiter who brought dinner to our room and the food itself was fantastic. Breakfast at the Lakeside was the same as usual. Lots of choices, attentive staff, good food, but we were seated right near the bussing station so were subject to the sound of dirty cutlery and plates being stacked and sorted. \n\nAfter experiencing the human soup at the pools, maneuvering around many children, experiencing lacklustre service from front desk staff and tea time ladies, and being forced to venture out of the toilet stall with an unwiped butt, I was really hoping for a nice quiet table with a view as a brighter moment in what was otherwise a somewhat disappointing trip. \n\nCan you step it up a little, HHSR?

To start with, lets go into what I did like and that was hot springs spa area. I really did like how that was set up even more so than at the Banff Springs, Miette, Radium and so on! I've been to some beautiful hot springs in Japan and this somewhat emulated those, which in that sense was quite impressive. This is way more natural looking. It is both a blessing and a curse that you have to be a guest at the hotel in order to use the hot springs (I'm guessing a spa guest as well). It's smart as keeps it not as crowded; however they should do what the Banff springs hotel does and just charge a higher rate than the public hotsprings. \n\nI also liked how the pools are divided into adults and kids sections. It makes it much nicer when you want to get some relaxation. Nothing worse then being at somewhere like the Upper Hotsprings in Banff and you get splashed by some kids. Nothing against kids but there is a reason their are escapes from them! And this hot spring makes that possible. The hours are another thing that makes this desirable as they are quite extended\u002Fadult only hours! Overall, these hot springs are so far the best I've been to in Canada!\n\nAs for what was not impressive, overall the hotel is very dated and it shows from when you enter the lobby and the hallways. This place is in major need of a renovation and has the potential to become a 4-5 star resort but they are a long way off. Don't get me started on how un-handicapped accessible this place is from all the awkward staircases that makes one feel like they are in an Egyptian pyramid. The hallways to the rooms and the room itself that we stayed on made me feel like I was staying in a ship! \n\nWe were told we would get a queen like we were getting a favor due to how busy it supposedly was. We booked online and their were tons of rooms left. I think we got the worst room in the hotel. It was small, we got a double bed, the window was half the size of that advertised in the picture of the basic room making us feel like we were in a basement suite. The only thing missing were mice!\n\nThe service is one of my biggest things a base a place on and with how we were treated\u002Fmislead at reception very disappointing! Probably the best service we received was the guy who grabbed our bags and took us to reception as well as the lady who replaced my girlfriends spa bracelet when it broke.\n\nSo overall, I am I dying to boast about the hotel, not exactly, however, Ill try it again but make sure to request the non-basement like room. The place is truly on a great piece of land in that if you can get that lakeview, the views seem like they would be stunning! For a spa-resort, the prices are actually not terrible. If you stay at the Banff springs hotel, you could be paying $400\u002Fnight for a room similar to what we got here where as, we only paid $169 (before taxes).

My morning soaks were very peaceful, however it was fun to be under the stars at night. \n\nThe resort is a three star property and as some of the other reviewers have mentioned it's an older property.  I would compare the room to a Ramada Inn or Red Lion.   We found our room to be simple and CLEAN with an amazing view.  We stayed in the West Wing Lake Front and the view of the mountains and water was wonderful.  Although the East Wing is newer,  I like the large balconies on the West Wing.  You could hear some sound between neighbors in the West Wing as well as hallway noise.  We didn\u2019t find the noise level to be a big deal.  We may bring a small fan for our next visit to provide some white noise.  We found the rooms to be VERY warm even with heater turned down, which is nice in the winter.  We would have liked a second chair in the room to sit and enjoy the view...one of us got the chair and the other had to sit on the bed or the desk chair, however this is not a complaint, but a wish list.  Also, we did not notice a smell as other reviews have mentioned and I have to say when I stayed at Ainsworth Hot Springs I did notice a musty smell from the hot springs, so I was prepared but didn\u2019t smell it.  I would love to see a juice bar added to the property as well as a daily yoga class!\n \nThe front desk customer service was excellent and helpful.  The Porters\u002FValet were AWESOME!

The Copper Room was a fun experience, especially with the dinner music from the Jones Boys band.  The food was typical hotel fare, meaning it was well prepared but simple.  Our Copper Room server was efficient but unpleasant.

Scenery second to none. Would certainly plan many returns for all occasions if I feel my points are acknowledged as I feel they are important and fair. \n\nCons: \n:Check in was 45 mins late on a Tuesday. We had a nice scenic drive around but due to our late check in we ended up at the back of the parking lot. Literally a football field length away if not further - from the back! \n:Despite our parking spot deep out back, we were unable to use a trolly for our belongings. While I understand the thought behind keeping the bellman and carts at the front of the building, the vast size of the property makes this inexcusable. If I was to check in with two suitcases, well then that certainly makes sense to pull up and allow them to cart my things to the room but while in the company of a dog (and we're both professional trainers) along with our things, holiday gifts, wine that cannot freeze... among another million things, pulling up to the front for 10 trips just wasn't suitable nor fair to the men out front. What I would suggest is that over the hour of check in as well as check out, you have one bellman able to oversee the trolly's from the back door. I do think this is too much to ask. Not only is it a long way, but your map on the back of your card booklets, is not user friendly for those checking in for the first time. It is actually horrible. It basically suggests that if you're left out back a mile that you shall enter through the main doors or otherwise try to piece it all together and I'm telling you it isn't pretty carrying your luggage from the east end of the parking lot to the WEST wing of the property. One of your cleaning ladies actually had a laugh with me as I tried to share my devised plan to pass over the water features in order to get around as there were NO real paths on the map whatsoever. \n: I was also disappointed by the following;\n- Room service food trays were left out in the halls WAY too long. Even for professional dog trainers this was a nuisance with our dog, never mind the eye sore of dirty trays and napkins. \n- While the cleaning staff were VERY sincere and friendly, I lost count of the amount carts that were basically jack knifed in the halls in which we had to awkwardly tip toe around during our check out. \n- We had a great big Olive or Grape clogging the drain of our sink. It was extremely obvious at a glance.

I was obviously concerned with some of the negative comments I had read here about the Harrison Hotsprings Resort and Spa.  I was hoping for the best, but regretfully I had a similiar experience like some of the others who have provided this resort with low ratings.   First the positives:  Using the internet and trip advisor, I realized that there are better accomocations in Harrison to spend a couple of days, but those hotels do not offer the hotspring pools, which was the only reason I was coming here this time of year.  This hotel has 5 pools, with convenient access from the West Tower, which is where I stayed. A spacious and shallow kids pool; an adult pool; a lap pool; a small indoor pool; and a round spa pool.  \n\nIf I do come back in the summer for golf or beach activities, (and not just the pools) I will not stay at this hotel.  There are other Hotels in Harrison about 100-200 yards away from this hotel, and based on their reviews, I would give them a try before I  came back here.\n\nWe also had a mess checking in.  Long line ups, with the same 4:00PM bottleneck that has already been described by others.  This problem has been self imposed on the staff and the guests by weak management, and could be fixed. \n\nParking is $4\u002Fday and this was well advertised.  It was not the $ that bothered me, but rather I find it irksome that a hotel would charge you $200+ for a basic hotel room, and then have the gall to tack on another $4, while making their guests walk 100-200 yards in the rain to reach their car. The same goes for towels or housecoats, which my room came with, but other rooms in the hotel do not.\n\nI booked one of those packages, which provided breakfast and dinner.  Breakfast was good.  Immediate offer of a pot of coffee, plus special attention given to my kids to make them feel welcome. Lots of items to choose from from the breakfast buffet menu, plus an ala-carte menu to choose from as well. \n\nI am unable to rate the food at the Copper Room however as we never got served. I made a reservation for myself and my two kids.  I arrived 5 minutes early and was seated precisely on time. After we were seated however, we waited 15 minutes before somebody finally came over and poured 3 glasses of water.   The bus-boy then advised me that our server would be right with us. I responded, \""that would be nice\""   We then waited another 5 minutes, but when nobody came we got up and left.  A very apologetic waiter chased us into the hallway and advised he had been busy with a large table, but he could in fact serve us now.  I said no thank you, and explained my boys were quite tired and we would just return to our room and order a pizza.   The food on the other tables looked good, but without proper service, it is pointless to have good food.  Again, this is a problem that has already been described in other posts, so it makes me wonder if management in this hotel is either ignorant of these issues, or just unable to address them.",2,negative

Because environment only matters if they can SAVE money. We brought our towels from our room to the pool only to find them MISSING when we got out. I assume they were taken by someone who didn't know to bring their own towels and couldn't ask because there was NO STAFF AT THE POOL to ask! So we walked dripping wet back to our room on that first night. How embarrassing. Disappointment #3\n\nOne one hand the fine dining experience in the Copper Room was expensive but excellent and well worth it. The food was top notch and so were the drinks and service. The lounge-music style band was cool. Great dining experience! Pool drinks came from the Copper Room so they were good too. On the other hand, the room service food was atrocious and disgusting. I believe the room service food came from the other restaurant on the second floor. I don't mind paying crazy room service prices, but only if the food is at least decent. Sorry but bad food just eclipses everything. Disappointment #4\n\nThe rooms were simply below average considering we paid an \""above average\"" price for our stay. This was a good 50 - 60% more expensive then your average Best Western but the quality of their rooms didn't reflect that. Little things like the shower curtain was broken, the toilet seat didn't stay up, many signs of damage \u002F wear and tear. Disappointment #5\n\nThe staff in the Copper Room (fine dining) was phenomenal, but the clerks were not. They simply didn't look like they wanted to be there. They did tell us how to find our room and where the elevator is. But as first time guests, it would be nice to hear about the hotel services like the location of the restaurants (didn't know there was more than one), location of the pools and the presence of a movie theater. Disappointment #6\n\nNot sure we're coming back.",2,negative

Should have known how our weekend was going to go by the number of unattended children running around and actually banging into guests, and the fact that no parents bothered to speak up to their children about their behaviour. \n\nOur room was on the third floor of the main hotel, with a partial view of two of the outdoor pools. The noise from the pools carried quite well, but we expected that as we kept our window open a tiny bit. \n\nThe room was small, though sufficient for our needs. The bed wasn't too bad, but the pillows were not up to par. The floor on my side of the bed (near the window) was considerably slanted downward toward the bed. Every time I walked there, it felt like I was on a boat. Robes to wear to the pools were provided, but were 'average' size, so did not fit my spouse. There were six towels for the two of us, which worked out just fine.\n\nThere was a plethora of children running up and down the halls, from early in the morning, to late at night. The hotel had a couple of sandwich board-type signs basically asking parents to control their children, but apparently a lot of parents were unable to read, or just didn't give a damn about what their children were doing. And apparently, neither did the hotel as I never once saw an employee say anything to any child or parent.\n\nThe gardens behind the hotel were only just starting to show signs of spring, so our visit was a bit too early for me to make any knowledgeable comments about them. However, I suspect they are very nice in bloom, if a bit small for the number of guests that this hotel usually sees.\n\nThe family pool was quite crowded and loud due to the number of families present. This was to be expected. Unfortunately, the adult pool is right beside the family pool, so the noise was almost the same there. The adult pool was also quite crowded, and though many of the guests were respectful of the others in the pool, many were not. The loud, drunken, adult children were especially fun, not to mention the mouth sucking, get-a-room, couples who sometimes made things a little uncomfortable (due to the close proximity). I noticed no hotel staff supervising the pools, hence the issues that made it difficult to enjoy our time there. No relaxation was to be had. Too bad, because it has a very nice setting.\n\nThe indoor adult hot pool was quite small, crowded and loud (again with drunken adult children). The indoor family pool was right beside it, so again with noise carry-over.\n\nAt both the outdoor and indoor pools, there are not nearly enough hangers for everyone's robes and towels. There are no lockers, so there is no guarantee that you will have a towel and\u002For robe for after you are done in the pool. We once had someone take my spouse's robe (with our room key in the pocket) out from UNDERneath my robe, swimsuit cover, and two towels on a hanger at the outdoor pool. The staff at the front desk said that it happens a lot. Then, at the indoor hot pool, when we went over to the one hanger we had our robes and towels on, we found that someone else had rearranged our belongings to get theirs up instead. \n\nThis was not the relaxing anniversary weekend we had planned. It was far too over-priced for what we got, the bad manners of other guests aside. I am quite disappointed. We will NOT be back.",2,negative

Our stay was enjoyable only because we were in good company. As for the hotel, considering how much we spent for the weekend stay, it was a bit of a disappointment. If it wasn't for the hot spring pools, we would have rather stayed at the Harrison Beach Hotel. I had booked a West Tower Executive Lake View room with a King Bed on the top floor (which happens to be the 6th floor). My reservation was booked over the phone and the guy I spoke to was helpful and told me that the room I was getting was one of the newer renovated rooms with modern furnishings. The room I had seen on the website and what was described to me over the phone was not the room I was given at time of check in. We were given Room 616. Everything was fine with the room except it was a Queen Murphy bed. The bed didn't have a proper head rest so they put one of those long roll decorative pillows behind the 3 soft pillows. The long pillow wasn't long enough for the bed so my side got stuck with a gap and I ended up grabbing the blanket in the closet to fill the gap and also grabbed the extra pillow. Sadly, it didn't make that much of a difference. I barely got any sleep and my neck is still sore. Thank goodness Sarah Jane at front desk was able to get me into another room. Room 612 was the room that I was expecting to get in the first place and the king bed was 100 times more comfortable then that Murphy bed. \n\nPros:\n\n- Hot Spring Pools: Open 5am - 1am (adults only after 11:30pm)\n- Restaurants were good: Enjoyed the Breakfast buffet at the Lakeside Cafe and had a great dinner at The Copper Room\n- Healing Springs Spa: Unfortunately, we didn't get a chance to check it out\n\nCons:\n\n- The hotel is dated (hallways in the main hotel seem creepy): they are long overdue for a major face lift.\n- Room descriptions on website are inconsistent & misleading: they cover their butts by noting \""Room photograph is for illustration purposes only & may not reflect the guestroom reserved\"")\n- Parking: all parking is outside, I was told verbally and had an email confirmation state that self parking was $8 but when we checked in, it was $10 (maybe weekend rates are higher?), We ended up going with valet because it was pouring rain and we arrived later than anticipated due to traffic and also, our friends were waiting for us. Valet is $15. If you get a cottage, parking is free).\n- Room rates seem high for what you get. It seemed so strange to me that there are no in room safes \n- Not sure how effective the \""Do not disturb\"" signs are because housekeeping was knocking at our door this morning.\n- Asked for a late check out and was unsuccessful: the hotel claims they were sold out. It's Sunday and I believe today is the last day of Spring Break. \n- Need to improve their check out system: the line up is long and takes forever.\n- ALWAYS check your hotel bill when checking out: the hotel is notorious for overcharging: our friends got charged for hotel robes which they had no desire of purchasing and they didn't lose them, our other friends got charged for the breakfast buffet (which we paid for and was correctly billed for), got charged for bottled water (which I bought at the corner store. Not even the same brand or size)\n- Robes seem cheap and are thin\n- Bedding is a joke: no comforter or duvet, it looks like a bed skirt or mattress cover - really pitiful.\n\nSince they have the hot spring pools, we're all at their mercy unless you're content  with the ghetto public pool.

In the room the carpet was very dirty and stained, doors are all dinged up and walls as well. The bathroom was however very clean, lots of towels and even nice bathrobes. We ordered room service which arrived within 20 minutes and it was very good.  The pools make up for the bad room.... however they are very crowded! We were there with two preteens so we did not go near the grossly crowded adult pool. We used the outdoor lap pool, perfect temperature and very clean and not so crowded.

We have had some great heritage rooms in the main hotel, with a high, molded ceiling, and also some not so great - including one with only one small window looking at a tar roof. The owners need to spend some money on updating, and just general maintenance, like repainting, cleaning mold\u002Fmildew from the exterior window frames.

We were upgraded to a wonderful room on the third floor overlooking the pools... we have been upgraded(at no extra cost to us) both times. this time we had a room in the main building with 2 beds a double and a twin.. which was just fine with us, a table large flat screen tv, and all the towels we ever could need.We were on the Seniors Getaway, it was included in the price 2 breakfasts each in the buffets dinning room, and dinner for two in the COPPER ROOM one evening. The choices at breakfast were wonderful, kept us going until early dinnertime. The evening we had our special meal in the C\u002FR we were the first to arrive..we like to get up at 5 am to use the round indoor hottest pool early before others show up, so we eat dinner early avoid the rush. We had the soup de jour, which was so delicious HOT and SOUR Asian soup, raspberry sorbet, then our main courses each ordering the steak...OMG that was a tender, tasty piece of beef, with mashed pot, and loads on fresh veggies. I couldn't even finish my vanilla cheesecake with cherries and dark chocolate.\nYes, the rooms could use a bit of an update, carpets, paint etc.  but when you stay at a 90+year old hotel what do you expect.

At $200 a night we were slightly disappointed at how basic the room was but shook it off as we reminded ourselves it wasn't nearly that much for us (we are from America so the exchange made it significantly less) and that we were there to enjoy the hot springs. Not the room. I am very glad we only stayed one night. The bed in our room was horrible! It was as hard as sleeping on the floor and my boyfriend and I both woke up with sore backs I was so thankful I was headed to the spa for a massage the morning of checkout! I know you can't please everyone when it comes to the firm\u002Fsoftness of a bed but I've never slept on such a hard bed in any hotel I've stayed in before! We arrived before 4 PM (the check in time) to discover a tiny tiny town about 3 blocks long that was very dead. At least half the business were closed, if this was seasonal or permanent I'm not sure. Luckily we were able to check in early without too much of a wait. Maybe during the summer when you can do lake activities it would be worth more then 1 night but the off season I wouldn't stay more then 1 night. The pools thankfully were not too packed although I feel like a second ring of seats in the middle of the adult pool would be beneficial as its just a large empty space no one uses as they prefer to sit on the bench that goes around the side. We went on a Sunday night and the benches were full. I can't imagine a busy weekend night during the summer you probably wouldn't have been able to really enjoy the pools they'd be so crowded. I have to agree with other reviews I read that its disappointing how chlorinated the pools are. It wasn't overpowering but you could smell it and I feel this defeats the purpose of the \""natural\"" hot springs. Also beware there will probably be couples who are over the top in their PDA to the point one couple made me uncomfortable and I ended up moving. Also perhaps the rules about the pools should be made more clear at check in. We ended up leaving the adult only outdoor pool a little early after a couple showed up with glasses (no glass is allowed near the pool) and started mixing drinks in the pool then they started up electronic music on a portable speaker. People are there to relax and the staff that showed up should have told them to turn it off not just turn it down. Both restaurants were also overpriced in our opinions. Ill save that for my review on the restaurants themselves though.\nOverall we did enjoy our evening and we made the most of it but we couldn't help but be disappointed in a place we had heard was supposedly so great. I honestly think they are way overpriced if you are paying full price in Canadian. We were thankful the exchange meant we paid less, technically.",3,negative

The adult pool is the hottest pool located outside where you can order some alcholic drinks... hence why it is the adult pool. Last but not least is the indoor pools\u002Fsauna.

We had realized that we should start to explore our own backyard; the resort's off season discount was quite inviting.\nWe start to drove in 6am in the morning. We stopped at Cultus Lake, and then to Bridal Falls which both were very worthwhile visit. No problem with car break in in these parking lots as many warning signs to tell people to do diligent to deter thief ( think about this when you pack.) I am a photographer and I put all my lens and camera into a packsack and carry it with me. Then we went to Othello tunnel for a hour walk, again highly recommended as the Fraser river provides many beautiful sceneries. \nWe arrived at Harrison Hot Spring resort by 1 pm afternoon and the check in was very smooth. The walk from the parking lot was relative long and confusing as the check in only gave us a small map and no arrow to show how to get into the building. Car parking was extra $10 per night, there is no free parking by the beach anywhere, hotel or not, $2\u002Fhour or $10\u002Fday. Hotel's charge was not a bad deal for parking overnight.\nSince we rented the lowest price room, we did not have high expectation. The room turned out quite comfortable and good size and it was facing the pool. We could hear the people splashing in the pool, but it did not brother us. However, my wife did complaint about the worker was talking too loud while they were placing the chairs, (Manage, please play attention to this little matter!). The room was located in the original building, so the door and design showed its age, but it was clean and we find it kind of charming. They have 2 new buildings which cost more to stay. All the quests got to use the same amenities, 5 pools of spring water with different temperatures. The water has no strong smell of sulfur at all and, ladies listen to this, the mineral in the water turn the skin to baby smooth instantly, no bull. Since I put my fingers into the water to test the temperature, I could feel the smoothness right away as soon as the water dry up. All quests were provided with a bathrobe and it was very convenience to enjoy the pool. Staying at this hotel, I did feel like staying at a resort. Besides the Spring, I enjoyed walking around the beach with my camera as the town consisted many businesses with artistic characters. Look for the cute Sasquatch that were sitting on the bench, look for the footprints.\nWe ate lunch at the Black Forest restaurant, probably the most popular restaurant in town. We ordered the Pork Hock and Schnitzel. To our surprises, the serving was hugh. We could barely finish half of the dishes and the waiter packed for us with plastic fork and knife to go. The service was excellent. The restaurant European d\u00E9cor felt like we were on a river cruise trip. By 4 pm, the hotel offered free tea, cake, and cookie.

It has been decades since we've visited Harrison and the hot springs were the main attraction of the resort.\n\nThe Harrison resort is quite old and there have been two new wings added to the original hotel: west and east, with east being the newest. We got a room in the main building. It was a bit cramped, old, but somewhat quaint. It was still a big mistake in restrospect! Why? Two big reasons:\n\n- no air conditioning (but the ceiling fan helped)\n- HORRIBLE SMELL from the hallways and the room! We weren't sure if it was the cleaning agents they use, or general mustiness from the old building. Or maybe a combination of both. We were on the 4th (top) floor, where the smell was most obvious.\n\nOur mistake was to not complain and switch rooms right away. We thought, \""It's only one night, so we can put up with it.\"" Well, I'm less picky and I adapted to the smell okay, but my wife complained throughout.\n\nWe met other visitors who booked in the newest east wing and they raved about their spacious 500 sq ft room, with air conditioning. And they only paid $20 more than us!\n\nI am now kicking myself for not doing more research to discover this ahead of time. I would most certainly have paid the $20 if I had known the differences. In my opinion, Harrison should make the disparity even greater: make the main building rooms $50 cheaper! I would never recommend the main building to anyone.\n\nOkay, aside from these gripes, we were pretty happy with the rest of our stay: the lobby is large, spacious, and comfortable. The employees were cheerful and helpful. There were several outdoor hot springs for us to enjoy (didn't visit the indoor ones). They were not too hot, but I'd like to see better lighting in the outdoor area at night. There is a conventional outdoor (mostly heated) swimming pool to swim laps. Our package included a buffet breakfast, which we enjoyed. There are several trails that you can hike close to the resort. And the strip on which the resort is located has many little restaurants and shops to browse. (A special shout out to this tiny little eatery run out of a trailer called \""JJCupBop\"".

I'm sure in its heyday this was a very nice hotel but there comes a time when you have to start doing renovations to justify the cost of the rooms.  It wasn't horrible.  Its just not worth the price you are paying for a very small, nothing included room.  I did not like having to pay for parking either.  I understand parking fees in large cities where parking is at a premium but this hotel has a huge lot right beside them.  If it belongs to the hotel, there really is no reason to charge their guests.  The pools were ok, but not spectacular.  Even though there is an adult pool, its right across from the kids pool so its not quiet or relaxing at all since you can still hear the screams and squeals of all the kids.  And there are only chairs there, no loungers so you can't stretch out on the deck.  We didn't eat at the restaurant so can't comment on that but did find it too expensive for our family of 5 to eat at.  When we arrived at the hotel, it was chaos at the front doors.

They have them locked up and you have to wait until someone is available to assist you.  While I know tipping isn't required for this, its expected and its just another way for them to nickel and dime you.  I also did not like having to pay an additional $20 per night for a cot.  These cots cost the hotel nothing and when you are already paying between 2 and 3 hundred dollars a night for a room, you'd think they could throw in the cot for free.  The rooms were so small it was difficult to even get the cot into a position where it wasn't blocking access to the bathroom or exit.  All it all, its an ok hotel, not great.

We are happy to have left the run down, dirty disaster unfittingly dubbed a \""resort\"".\n\nUpon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by staff that seemed to hate their jobs. All our subsequent interaction with staff was less than pleasant. When we opened the door of our room, we were hit by a mouldy stench that offered a good indication of what our room would be like once inside. \n\nThe room was unlike any hotel room I have ever been in. Essentially a bed, a table, and a mini fridge on the floor, the room was spartan to say the least. We had no working air conditioning, the paint was on the walls was chipping, the room was horribly outdated, and our walls were incredibly thin. It felt like a dungeon that we'd shelled out $200+ per night on. Neither my partner nor I could sleep peacefully because of the noise permeating through walls, both from the room beside us and from the room above us.  \n\nMy most significant complaint with this \""room\"" was that the bed did not have a fitted sheet. The sheet easily slid, and it wasn't long into the night before both my partner and I were sleeping on an uncovered mattress. Assuming the bed is slept on my multiple guests per week, on average, and that the mattresses themselves are not cleaned between each guest, this means that we were essentially sleeping in the dead skin, hair, and sweat of the many guests who had the misfortune of staying there prior to us. When I requested a fitted sheet after our first night there, the staff member I spoke to assured me I would get one posthaste. It likely goes without surprise that the fitted sheet never arrived. When I brought this up with a staff member at checkout, she told me that \""the hotel doesn't do fitted sheets\"". I am appalled. \n\nMy disgust at sleeping on a dirty mattress was compounded when a friend of ours also staying at the hotel found a bedbug on her sheets (see attached image).When my friend brought this to the attention of the staff, she was denied in her request to speak to management, and was laughed at by the individual with whom she was speaking. \n\nTo say we won't return to this hotel may be the understatement of the year.

I had a hard time accepting this.\n\nLuckily, Tripadvisor had a rate with a partner for the same amount in the West Wing that was larger, more modern and air conditioned.  This turned out to be a good find as I was happy with the room.  It faced a lovely garden, and was away from the pool - so was quiet day and night.  The furniture was decent enough, and the bed comfortable.\n\nThe hotel is charming in a sprawling sort of way.  It has a myriad of different extensions from over the years - I'm sure the East Tower would be the nicest, followed by the West Tower, then West Wing.  The staff were friendly enough - my only gripe was that they wouldn't let us check out late due to its busy state.  Luckily they allow people to use the facilities until early afternoon.\n\nThe pools and pool area themselves are wonderful - some of the best I've ever seen.

This was our first time staying at this hotel, We were thinking about doing there getaway package that included two nights stay with breakfast and one fancy dinner in the Copper room, that I heard was very nice. But the price was around Cad$750, add parking your car for two nights, and at least one extra dinner and now you are close to Cad$900. This is way to much money for what it is, so we decided to do the one night with breakfast that includes breakfast for Cad$169. That way we could still go and relax and swim in all the hot springs pools they offered. We live in South Delta so the drive took us just under two hours, we went the long way through Mission to get there, more scenic. And the highway to get back with a few stops. They were able to check us in right away with our room being ready around 1pm. we stayed in the east tower facing the mountains, the lake and the front entrance. We were in room #715 and had a small deck with table and two chairs. The east and west tower rooms all have air conditioning , while the  oldest original part does not. The rooms are very simple and basic, feels like a Best Western. They really need to do a major renovation of all the rooms. The best thing they have are the five hot springs pools you get to visit, I also really enjoyed the steam room. They do offer afternoon tea and goodies by the pools when the weather is good, was a nice touch. There are still a lot of tour groups that stop here for the night. Breakfast buffet in the morning was really nice on the second floor, but it can be quite busy with tour groups. The omelet maker was really nice, and a lot of people tipped him for the service. After all afternoon hanging out by the pools and sipping our margaritas we walked down ten minutes from the hotel to the Black Forest for schnitzel and red cabbage plus fried potatoes and veggys,, This dinner was the best we have ever tasted, and the service was also very good, We grabbed a piece of black forest cake to share in our room later after our walk. Later in our room we sat out on the deck to have our cake and was delicious and light. We tried to go back the next day before heading home to purchase two more slices of cake ,but we were told they had run out. We were disappointed, but that's our luck. I would highly recommend this restaurant. As for the hotel save your self some money and just stay room only for one or two nights, there is a Starbucks with all kinds of morning goodies for you. For us we only need a hot drink and a baked item anyways. As long as you get time to see and spend time in the five pools that they offer.

The pools, there are 4 ranging from quite hot to almost cool (but still heated) are well kept and the garden-like setting is lovely.\nYes, the main building is perhaps a bit dated by now. But our room was very clean, cosy and comfortable. The absence of air conditioning in that area is no problem in the off-season. In summer, the newer west wing which does have air conditioning would be preferable. Their \""get-away\"" packages for accommodation and certain meals are very good value.\nThe Copper Room is still a lovely place to relax, dine and dance. We had a delicious meal. And yes, they have music to dance even for the older, emh \""mature\"" generation. \nIf the confines of the hotel is too small for ones taste, the resort is located at one end of a lovely walkway, quite recently renewed, along Harrison Lake.",5,positive

There were multiple conventions booked and we did not get our room until after 5 pm, but everyone who was there for the conventions seemed to get their swipe cards to their rooms within minutes, which we observed while waiting.  We requested a swipe card to use the main floor washrooms, unfortunately the swipe cards did not work for anyone and we were told the Engineer was busy and it would take some time before he could get to the problem.  We were given directions by the Hotel Clerk which took us on a long goose chase to finally find them - no signs in place to follow.

Okay a bit more expensive than I would have thought but what the hell.. downtown Vancouver hotels aren't much different if not more expensive. \n\nUpon check-in, I was glad I didn't get to experience the huge line ups some people have previously mentioned. Though one guy did butt in front of me, but the desk agent was nice and apologized to me for him. \n\nOur room was on the ground floor of the west wing. The room was clean and a decent size. The usuals for a hotel room included of course; bar fridge, coffee pot, the beds, bathroom etc. A bit old looking, but the age of the hotel doesn't really affect my view too much.\n\nWi-Fi was a bit spotty and is unencrypted. If you care about those things, bring a travel router with you. There was an Ethernet port attached to the lamp between the beds, it would have been nice to utilize that but it probably wasn't plugged in. \n\nThe beds were comfy though. \n\nThe pools of course are great. Recommend starting in the indoor hot tub that's like 104F. Then work your way to the outside pools. There is a bar available for walk up service if you want to get your drink on. \n\nWe didn't go into the Adult pool as it was crowded. They need to redesign it in my opinion. If they added a seating area in the middle, they would get more people into the pool as everyone just sits around the edge of it. \n\nOur door keys had issues for duration of our stay as did a lot of other people we ran into while trying to open doors. They asked if the card was near a cellphone, nope it wasn't but who knows. That just requires you to go to the front desk and have them reprogram it\n\nThe included Breakfast Buffet was great! Typically $22 per person it was included in our price (think we saved like $4?). Ken (the guy at the omelet station) was awesome and a lot of fun. He's got making an omelet down to a science and an art. Does them like 7 at a time or so!\n\nThe breakfast food was good and always fresh even up to the last 30 minutes before the buffet was closed (we got there with 30 minutes to spare). So if you're late to the buffet your food experience should still be good! \n\nCheckout was a breeze, as the line up at checkout time was doubled on itself (easily 40+ people) we just filled out the little form and dropped it off in the box at the front and walked out.\n\nWas the stay $300\u002Fnight worthy? I don't think so. I would definitely look at booking a discounted stay if there were ones available. $199\u002Fnight with the buffet would be good. \n\nWe did not check out the Copper Room this time around as the prices not reasonable when we've already spent $299 on the room.

This is the resort with the actual hot springs pools. There was a special for mid-week stays which included buffet breakfast, so we thought that it was a very good deal for the money. We are from the US and the exchange rate is favorable right now, which was also handy.\n\nWe went up to the hot springs with my parents and my husband and daughter, who is three years old. We all had an excellent time. Mid-week there were a lot of families with young children, and many retired folks.\n\nThe pools were not too crowded, clean and beautiful. There are many pools- one adult-only pool which is hotter, a lap-pool which is cooler, a pool with an easy-in ramp on one side instead of stairs and seats all around most of the edge, which was excellent for toddlers as it was a good bathwater temperature. There is also a slightly cooler pool and a very hot hot-tub pool in an indoor space. There are additional pools inside the spa which i did not visit. The indoor dressing area in the building containing the indoor pools had a sauna room, a shower, and bathroom inside the ladies section. I assume the men's side did as well?\n\nOnce i have warmed up in a pool, i don't mind a few moments of cold going back into the hotel, but my mom was very cold during that transition! The hotel provides one-size-fits-all robes which were very large on us but serviceable, but does not provide slippers, and your feet might be very cold or feel strange walking across the hotel to the pools and back without them, so i recommend bringing slippers which can get wet!\n\nThe hotel booking came with breakfasts and with an afternoon tea at 4pm, which was tea and cookies, and was fun to do. The breakfast buffet had an impressive selection in a dining room with a beautiful view- ask for a table by the window, but they fill up fast! I don't think i would have purchased a $22 breakfast buffet except that it came with our special deal. We very much enjoyed it, as it is unusual for us to have a large breakfast- we are not heavy eaters. The quality would not hold for a gourmet, but it was fun for sure. The breakfast had excellent juices and real whipped cream, either pancakes or waffles and toppings, omelette bar, soups, granolas, toasts and baked goods such as muffins and croissants, cereals, fruit salad, bacon and sausage, and probably other items i missed.\n\nOur rooms were in the East Wing, and were very clean and roomy. The bathroom was large with a deep soaking tub and a long counter. The water pressure was excellent and the water got very hot right away if you like, which was very nice! Some of the fixtures are not very new, and the carpet had some sun or bleach spots in one place, but it really didn't detract from our experience at all. I don't think i would have noticed it except that i read some reviews before we left which complained of it, so i wanted to see how i felt about it. The beds were super comfortable and very clean. They provided pool towels and regular towels. The towels could have been softer, but they were suitably large. The pillows were excellent in my opinion, liking a feather pillow in my own home, these were filled with something that you can squish into shape, if you know what i mean- not one large fluff. I think they had more than one kind of pillow per bed. We had balconies with beautiful views of the forest and the lake, and had no trouble with noise. The balconies have two chairs and a small table. The room had air conditioning and heating, but we did not need to use it during our stay. The room comes with a coffee maker and two mugs, and an ice bucket and four glass cups, which was nice as we are a family of three. (My parents had their own adjoining room.) There was a mini-fridge in the room, which they called a \""beverage cooler\"". We overfilled it and some leftovers got close to frozen, which we did not mind as it kept them fresh. (You can't expect too much from a small mini-fridge!) It didn't freeze any of the drinks we put into it.\n\nAround town, Blackforest the German restaurant and Kitami Japanese restaurant were both excellent. We went on a boat ride on the lake and it was fun, though the boat went slowly. There were rentals for all kinds of powered and human-powered boat rentals, so hopefully next time my husband and i can go faster in one of those. We also hiked in the area and the surroundings, and it was very beautiful. We had exceptionally nice weather for most of our trip, sunny and kind of warm even. We have been in the winter and i think it is very fun to be in a warm hot springs while it snows all around you. Once in the pool, it doesn't matter if it's raining or snowing!\n\nMy husband and i have stayed at the Harrison Hot Springs at least two other times, and each time i wish we had stayed longer.

On our latest visit (June) we were given a room in the old part of the hotel overlooking the pools It was just fine and had gone through a recent up grade-  the twin queen beds had quality bedding and we could shut down the ac\u002Fheater with a switch on the unit. Great we thought until a persistent thumping began. As it turned out we were above the fitness room where some one was on a running machine. A phone complaint to the desk did not solve the problem and they said it would stop at 10 or 11 when the fitness room was closed for the night. (As an aside when we checked out they promised us a free upgrade on our next visit) The Pools are great and the indoor pool is really hot. We enjoyed the cool outdoor swim  pool where we could swim lengths. Dinner in the copper room is formal - the band did a fine job of playing music more or less suitable for  older folks - waltzes but occasionally interjected something a bit more suitable for the younger set. The menu selection was limited but what came was quite good and served with a flourish. However portions were small and if you are a big eater you might leave still hungry.

It was lucky it was not at a busy time as later we witnessed long queues waiting to get all the paperwork that seemed to need doing completed. Sadly, my room, No 200 was very disappointing. Rather tiny, with a very small double bed or maybe it was a large single in it and very poor natural light, which wasn't helped by the fact it had been decorated in a depressing dark gun-metal grey colour with equally grey pictures of tempest\u002Fstorms on the walls. It certainly looked as though the interior designer had been a manic depressive at least.\n The view was over a broken and tatty canopy and then on over the pool. Additionally it was also extremely noisy, with every person walking or talking outside echoing along the corridors late into the night. Unfortunately, this was not helped by the large gap under the door which also let the corridor light in at night, making it hard to darken the room to a comfortable, sleep inducing state.\nThe breakfast was great, although again, there was a queue and more laborious paper work to undertake before we could be checked into the restaurant with our 'inclusive' ticket, which became increasingly tedious since there were 4 of us.

Food purchased from vending machine in the hotel was a month expired. They demanded I go downstairs for a refund, then had no idea how to do it, after I waited in line again?!

data\ca\154931\183786\538823424.html,Harrison Hot Springs Resort &amp; Spa,"""I've been a regular guest at Harrison Hot Springs Resort & Spa since the mid 70s. For the last few years I've stayed there at least once a year with either my husband, or both my husband and brother, for 1 or 2 nights at a time. Many friends and family also regularly visit the resort to enjoy the hot pools and quiet beautiful surroundings. It's always been a relaxing and quiet break to look forward to - at least until my latest stay with my husband and brother for 2 nights on Oct 24 - 26. Sadly, the hotel has gone downhill since my last stay in Feb of this year. There were several issues this visit as outlined below, the worst of which was over 3 hours of loud intrusive leaf blowing on the 2nd day, from noon until after 3pm, which started up again in the morning of the final day. \n\nMinor issues included: bungalow rentals now come with a $10 a day parking fee, whereas previously bungalow parking came with the rental; free newspapers are no longer provided; bungalow beds (especially the hide-a-bed) were old and uncomfortable; although we asked for a hypoallergenic room and were told bedding was fragrance free, we had to wash all our clothing when we returned home to remove the odour; my $60US Super Feet sandals, that I left by the pool when I got in to soak, were accidentally taken on the 1st night and not returned to lost and found. I found them the next day by someone else's robe. The same thing happened to another guest on the 2nd night while we were soaking. So, I would advise guests not to wear expensive flip flops or sandals to the pools. \n\nHowever, the major issue during this stay was the hours of leaf blowing by the pools that disturbed the peace and quiet. The leaf blowing started up at around noon on the 2nd day of our stay, near the pools while we were soaking, and then for another 3 hours all around the grounds and in the vicinity of our bungalow where we were having lunch. The sound was extremely loud and annoying and carried all around the grounds. The following day the leaf blower started up again near our bungalow at around 10am, while we were packing up to check out. Both my husband and I have allergies, so not only was the noise an issue, but so was the dust particles being blown around our bungalow, as well as the fumes from the blower.\n\nI complained several times to the blower operator and the management and asked for the leaf blowing to stop. Nothing happened. In fact the facilities manager was very rude and dismissive. No apology offered. He didn't appear to realize how loud and offensive the leaf blower was at 77 decibels, and how the sound carried throughout the grounds. I was accused of 'stalking\"" the leaf blower because I shot a few minutes of video of the leaf blower, mainly close to our bungalow, to demonstrate how loud it was, and as proof of the issue. I was accused of threatening the facilities manager because I said I would post my video to social media. When I vehemently denied both these accusations I was told that I was \""yelling\"" and that the manager would call the RCMP. And, finally, when I asked the leaf blower operator just before check out time on the last day why he couldn't have waited until after checkout, and asked why he told the manager I was \""stalking\"" him, he swore at me in language I can't repeat here. Fine customer relations indeed!\n\nThe resort is advertised on google as \""With soothing spa & natural hot springs our BC resort hotel is the ultimate retreat. Re-discover relaxation at this British Columbia resort hotel.\"" I've never heard of a resort and spa annoying its guests with loud obnoxious leaf blowers. Surely, the Resort's prime purpose is to ensure the quiet enjoyment of their guests, not the opposite? \n\nI was a paying guest of Harrison Hot Springs Resort and Spa, there for a quiet vacation and to soak and swim in the outdoor hot pools. My vacation was far from quiet and relaxing. I cannot recommend that anyone visit Harrison until the management finds a less noisy and intrusive, and more environmentally sound, way of clearing their leaves in the fall -- i.e. rakes and brooms. Harrison Resort has been around since the late 19th century. Somehow they managed their leaves before the invention of leaf blowers. There really is no good excuse for having to use these.",2,negative

The resort's reservation form invites you to let them know if you have any questions or special requests, but apparently nobody reads them.  The first time we stayed here we found the robes left in the room for us were too small for my partner, so we phoned housekeeping, were told to go to front desk, waited around for about half an hour till they finally found him a large one.  To avoid wasting any of our short stay this time I emailed ahead and asked to have a large one in the room upon arrival.  We arrived with a plan to go in the pool right away, but the robe wasn't there.  So I went down to the desk for one, and the employee I spoke with actually said \""That's not my jurisdiction\""...  weird... anyway, two phone calls and an hour and a half later we received a robe.  \n\nThe healing springs spa website offered RMT services upon request, and one of the four spa treatments we booked was an RMT massage.  The booking was confirmed by the spa weeks before arrival.  After our treatments I asked for the RMT receipt and was told \""We don't actually have any RMTs here\""  and \""Whoever told you that, shouldn't have\"".  After looking up our prior email correspondence, they realized they had confirmed it, and offered us a discounted price on that massage.\n\nThe spider situation was out of control.  I realize it's fall, but the first thing we noticed coming out of the elevator was the view of the lake was obscured by spiders, webs, and eggs. (photo attached).  The balcony of the room was just covered in them too.  There was also a spider in my massage room.  Not relaxing...creepy.\n\nThere were several other little things that made this stay disappointing, room service meal was insanely salty, beds were not comfortable, breakfast pancakes hard like cardboard, etc.  The wristband thing seemed kinda pointless because half the guests weren't wearing them, and no one was checking anyway.  I guess if I were to state a positive it would be that sitting in the pools was nice.  I mean, sure, I've stayed in worse hotels - but not for this much money.  Upon checking out we were not asked by any staff member how our stay was.  It seems the resort has gone downhill, which is sad because it could be a really great place, if the management and staff actually cared at all.",2,negative

Stand-out attractions: obviously, the mineral pools at various temperatures AND an adults-only pool (which we valued highly), the food in the Copper Room is outstanding as is the wine selection, our room was huge and beautiful, the lobby is a quiet refuge rather than a circus or a utility and the night club (also in the Copper Room) was a visit to the Cotton Club, 1946, with a raised art deco bandstand and a huge dance floor lit from below.  While current styles are ultra casual, I wished I'd known about the night club ahead of time, we'd have brought evening clothes and put on the ritz!

The pool area was also not very clean, in fact when we returned home we both got sinus infections. The spa services were sub par even though the prices as high.  For the money I'd go somewhere else.  After a late visit at the Spa I was returning to my room when I hear a guest commenting on the noise in the hotel.  I also hear a security guard on his walkie talkie reporting a problem of a group of loud drunk guys that needed to be broken up.  When I got to the area that the guys were no security or hotel staff were around.  There were 6 or so guys.  Really loud and really drunk.  They made their way to the elevators and I decided to wait before heading up as I was in my hotel robe and  I didn't feel comfortable or safe.  I waited for about 10 minutes or so but then the guys decided not to go up the elevator but rather go find more alcohol.  When they moved from the elevators doors I quickly got in and went up to my room.  One of them got in behind me and made a few flirty comments but I was able to get off the elevator quickly. I reported the incident to the hotel manager when I checked out of the hotel.

Overall, the experience was mediocre and very pricey for the services we got. The booking process was done over the phone and was very quick and easy. When we got to the resort, there was a big line-up for check-in (we waited around 45min in the line-up). Check-in was supposed to be at 4pm but our rooms weren't cleaned so the receptionist said they would give us a call when the rooms were ready. We waited around until 5:30pm before we went back up to the desk to ask if the rooms were ready- which they were but for some reason we weren't called. This seems to be happening to a few other guests as well since the lobby was full of people waiting. When we got to the rooms they didn't provide us with enough towels and bath robes for everyone, which normally isn't a big deal since they can just bring up more. But given the fact that we had to wait an extra 1.5 hours for our rooms to be ready you'd think they would at least know how many guests are expected in each room. We also noticed that the breakfast buffet coupons and Copper room coupons were written for the wrong number of people. We had 3 people in one room and 2 people in the other, we only got vouchers for 4 people. They did correct this when we pointed it out but it is still poor service. The resort itself was good, I really enjoyed the festive decorations and the Christmas activities they had planned e.g. movie room, Christmas carol singers and Mrs Claus reading to the children etc. The hot springs were really nice, although it is very busy, and I made full use of the pool bar. The breakfast buffet was average in quality but there were lots of different choices that would suit everyone's tastes. The omelette chef was excellent. The Christmas dinner in the Copper Room was awful. The turkey and fish were dry and tasteless, the service was also mediocre. The only good thing about the Copper Room was that it was beautifully decorated and the live band + dance floor were great. The best part about the whole experience was definitely the hot springs in the evening time and the spa services. I had a couples massage done by David and Yolanda- 10\u002F10 top notch. Yes it was pricey but worth every penny. The only criticism I have would be that the couples room was just a hotel room with 2 massage beds and was outside of the actual spa so it didn't really have a spa-feel but once you close your eyes to enjoy the massage it really didn't matter.\n\nIt was nice to have visited the resort once but I probably wouldn't go back again.

I had asked for either a window or a view of the band.  There were two tables right in front of us and the whole dance floor, so definitely not a view of the band.  Our server was an older gentleman, Bart I believe his name was, he forgot our first drinks we ordered, but was quick with the bottle of wine, told him we would have the drinks after our meal, and he forgot that too.

The band was good, you could say we felt like we were in the Dirty Dancing Movie, such an old time feel to the place.  Which we like!\nThe brunch in the Copper Room on Monday morning is a whole other story.....Our server, another older Gentleman, was so unkempt and The employer, the Hotel\u002FRestaurant really needs to address this issue.  His apron was just filthy, as were his pants, that were obviously too big for him, but they were just plain dirty!  I said no to a refill of coffee but he just said he would top it up anyway, dragging the dirty coffee caraffe across my plate and my food, needless to say I didn't finish my meal.  The Brunch was to include Champagne and OJ, but they only served it after as we were leaving. No explanation as to why it wasn't served when we were seated.  The food was very good though. \n\nThe night that we were to have turn down service, I had called to report that we did not receive it or housekeeping, she said it would be on my file.  When we were checking out not a word was mentioned from the person at the front desk.  Yes the hotel is old, but that shouldn't mean that the service is so poor.  We spent $1500 + for the weekend, and that is the part that upsets me.  We don't mind paying for great service, but that was a lot of money to not receive what was promised or for such poor service. Why have huge expensive packages like this when you obviously do not have the staff to do it well? And to just ignore the patrons and the issues brought up is just plain wrong.  \nI do not know if we will ever be back, even though we have had such good memories here in the past.....",2,negative

Had we not asked for them, would we have been charged for not leaving them in our room on departure as the sign warns us?\n- Cork screw but no wine glasses in room - another call to housekeeping - another tip.\n- REALLY uncomfortable furniture everywhere in the hotel - old, out dated, grubby and very uncomfortable to sit on for any length of time. This, unfortunately, includes the beds.\n- No towel service in gym (or at the springs). The gym equipment is seriously outdated. The fabric on the benches and machine seats is ripped and stuffing is coming out. The free weight bench wobbles\n- The gym smells bad - likely because of the ancient, ripped CARPET on the floor. Treadmill feels like running on cement with cement shoes.\n- After 2 winter visits, I'd say this should be renamed the \""Warmish Springs\"" - the temperature in the springs pools was rarely above body temperature the whole time we were here. Had to find a spot near the valve area if we wanted to stay warm. The children's pool is downright cold. One day the pools were below body temperature and no one was able to use them. No consideration was given to anyone's expectations.\n- Coffee quality varies widely - despite using the Starbuck's name, they don't adhere to SB's quality standards. While the coffee shop serves a decent cup first thing in the morning, it's a crap shoot afterwards with coffee flavour deteriorating as it sits all day in its carafe.\n- I've never seen dirtier windows in a building - NEVER\n- Terrible connectivity with wifi - unable to load photos into Facebook due to small bandwidth.\n- The SPA advertises RMT's in its brochure but is unable to provide you with one! \n\nThe Ugly-\n\n- Do not book an \""Executive\"" Suite and expect a king size bed. Despite massive amounts of floor space, someone thinks a soft, uncomfortable queen sized bed is what a person paying top dollar really wants to sleep in. \n- Do not expect the Executive Suite to have a seating area for more than one person. \n- Do not expect anyone from management to give a moment's care for your experiences and expectations - the fact that the Executive Suite picture advertises a king sized bed but most of these suites have a queen size doesn't seem like false advertising to them. Front desk manager Nicki got right on changing the wording in the advertisement though! The wording was changed within a few moments of our complaint but nothing was done to improve our situation and discomfort.\n- No room safes - in 2018 I've come to expect this wherever I stay and am finding these safes in even inexpensive hotels. Booking an Executive Suite and the having to go down to the front desk to leave your wallet and passports with the staff every time you want to visit the springs is ludicrous. \n- Basically do not book an Executive Suite - it offers absolutely no advantage or comfort to do so.\n\nWe have stayed here twice - because it's winter and we like outdoor hot springs - but we won't stay here again as even the hot springs were disappointing. We have also stayed twice at the Beach Hotel and it provides much better value.",1,negative

We paid an exorbitant amount for a small dark room which barely canceled the noise from the outside allowing the yelling and whaling from children outside to interrupt our sleep. The main attraction (hot spring pools) were lukewarm at best. The best of the bunch was the indoor adult pool which was too small and invaded constantly by loud obnoxious brats under no adult supervision. After the disappointing pool experience, we decided to sit down for a small meal and drink at the bar. The view was decent but the food, if it can be called food, was insulting at the least. After two bites and a couple of french fries we started to feel sick and decided to abandon our meal in order to avoid spoiling what was left of our evening.The lack of attention by the staff is concerning only the guy at the valet who directed us to the parking area made us feel welcome and valued. \nOther things we noticed and concerned us were the lack of cleanliness of the bathrooms in the pool area.

The town was dead, and most businesses closed, but the resort was full.  The staff, God bless 'em, were very, very busy, and yet unfailingly cheerful, helpful and polite.  \n\nThere were a few disappointments:  \n\nOur west tower room was very much smaller in person than it appeared in the resort's publicity.  That was the work of a skilled photographer, I'm sure.  There was just enough space in the room for the two double beds, and the toilet and bathing facilities were very cramped.  Note to management:  not a good idea to begin a guest's experience by making them feel misled about the accommodations.  Nevertheless, the beds were comfortable and the space adequate, if just barely.\n\nDining opportunities were quite limited.  The only breakfast choices were the overpriced breakfast buffet, or Starbucks.  The only lunch options were the bar, or Starbucks.  During the off-season when most other restaurants in town are closed, this is a real drawback.  Fortunately, we found the in-house bar to be very comfortable and hospitable, with an adequate, if limited, lunch menu.\n\nBut staying at the resort in the off-season is all about the hot spring pools, and it's definitely worth it.  There is a pool for every different temperature and sociability preference.  Soak your cares away under dripping cedars and misty skies, then nap, eat, and soak again.  Once we had slipped into the routine, we didn't need much else.\n\nOn our last night, a Thursday, our experience was somewhat marred by a small number of rather rowdy guests who brought coolers of beer to the adult pool.  This is theoretically not allowed, but there were no staff members present to enforce the rules.  We left earlier than we otherwise would have.  Not surprisingly, we were awakened later that night by a lot of noise in the hallway: loud voices, heavy footsteps, and doors slamming.  In the morning, we found half-empty drinks and spilled snacks in the corridor between our room and the elevator.  Not exactly \""family-friendly.\""\n\nI assume that some of these rough spots had to do with the difficulty of fully staffing the resort for spring break, during an otherwise slow season.

I was horrified to read what others went through and to see pictures of their rooms. Over all I really liked my time here. \nThe 4 PM tea was a surprise and one I liked. Whatever I told them I wanted they gave me 2 of! \nA few times there was a long line at the front counter for reception so I did not stay and other times I could walk right up. I enjoyed the gift shops as it seemed a cut above the rest after being at several other hot springs this winter. They are all different in their own way. \nI did find the walk a bit far to the pools from the new section but it was well worth it. It would have been great to stay in the old section and be closer but I was more than happy with my room and thought the ones who walked right out their patio doors probably got lots of noise too. My room was quiet. The balcony was a bit small and maybe next time I will see if I can get a room with a better view although I could see the water and mountains I mostly saw a roof. \nHousekeeping was great. The only problem I had was this hotel will not put a plus size robe in your room ahead for you like other resorts do, I tried to reserve one and was told no. I couldn't believe the sass I got over this and being told they do not have enough because people steal them etc. Isn't that why you get a credit card number? So once at the hotel I called down and asked for one to be sent up and they said they would see but could not promise, totally the way they said it was unprofessional  but I soon had a knock on the door and they handed me one so it worked out. The smoothness of their delivery on the phone needs work. It is first come first serve with plus size robes.  \nI liked all the pools, I tried 5 and glad there was an adult only section. Although the kids section is in the middle so noise of screaming kids can be heard all day and evening. No one reads to the signs such as in the reflection indoor pool that was beautiful at night but there are serval no diving signs but people do it anyways. Reflection and the other signs to me meant thinking and relaxing but people wonder in all loud and obnoxious. \nI did not like the drinking that was allowed as no other resort I was at this winter allowed alcohol in the pools, a couple told me they were given glasses for their booze at the front desk so I checked with front desk and they confirmed alcohol was allowed as long as no can or bottle was showing and only cups so I watched as people went every 5 mins and filled their cup from their pack or behind a rock you knew what they were doing. There was only one lady using the walk up bar, I can see how this would be a huge money maker but very dangerous to mix alcohol with sun and slippery decks. It did ruin it in my opinion to see so much alcohol as it was more like a bar then a health spa. \nIn fact a lady did fall getting out of the hot tub and there was blood everywhere as she hit her head and elbow. Again I checked with the front desk and was told this happens a lot. \nI tried the spa and while it was not bad it was not great either especially for $184.00, when booking I was told I could come from the pools and my wet clothes would be put in the dryer but nothing like that happened. I sat there waiting getting cold and the 2 young girls at the front counter where unprofessional but I gathered that may be the case because when I called to book and read right off their website that I wanted the 75 minute hot stone massage they said they did not have  that and only 65 minutes. The website still says 75 mins for $175.00 for the hot stone and I paid $184.00 with tax. I will not get services there again if I go back. I was not offered a drink or anything.\nThe fine dining and music was very lovely and I enjoyed it all, not one complaint. \nThe lounge the next day was a turn off after the waitress serving me sniffled and coughed away and when I commented on it she told me she had been sick for 2 months. I wish people would stay home and get better instead of possibly infecting everyone else. \nThe grounds were beautiful and the shopping was close.

We booked in the West Tower, 6th floor, lake view. \nSo the good first: \nNo problems getting exactly the room I asked for. After reading the reviews on this site, I knew I wanted to avoid the older rooms and am very glad I did. \nThe room itself is a clean, standard hotel room with two queen beds, as requested.  Everything works, lots of towels, the beds are comfortable enough and the sheets are clean. \nThe view of the lake is lovely, and I have not experienced undue levels of noise. \nHousekeeping, front desk and Island Bar staff are all pleasant and professional.  We didn\u2019t go to the Copper Room, so I can\u2019t speak for that venue.  \nThe pools are really nice.  We have tried all of them.  The big outdoor pool is actually a refreshingly cool but not cold temperature and it has been really enjoyable for swimming.  The adult hot pool is my other favourite, nice and warm.  We booked during the week, so we haven\u2019t had to experience much in the way of obnoxious drunken shenanigans, so that has been an extra bonus in my opinion.  \nI booked an 80 minute \u201CHealing Springs Signature Massage\u201D and it was very nice.  It cost $215.00 (plus gratuity) and, based on what I know of massage costs this doesn\u2019t seem at all unreasonable. The massage therapist concentrated on the areas I had indicated were giving me problems and I also received a foot massage and soak. Very nice way to spoil myself!\n\nAnd the less good \nI want to note that I haven\u2019t experienced anything I would call \u201Cbad\u201D.

There is an inescapable musty odour everywhere, but it is most evident when you are working your way through the maze of hallways between your room and the pool. I also took the stairs down one floor in the West Tower, to get ice, and those stairs are really musty, dirty-looking and truly unpleasant.  \nThe pools could use a good scrub and fresh paint.  The change rooms could use a major refresh too.  \nCoffee maker, corkscrews, all those little things are pretty beat up.  Same goes for the bathrobes - they are clean, but the hems have puckered and there is fraying.  The furniture is a little beat up - not major issues but it does create a bit of a seedy, \u201Cseen better days\u201D ambiance that might or might not be what the Resort is trying to present. \nAlso please note - early May seems to be manure laying season for both the Resort and the town, so the swampy sewer smell is quite prevalent. \nAll in all, I would say my experience is positive.

The pools are surrounded by rocks and evergreen trees to give a natural feel and it really does pull it off. It is extremely relaxing. This is the ONLY reason I come. On our first time to Harrison a few years back, we stayed at a much newer hotel (Harrison Beach Hotel) located a few blocks away but we could not buy a day pass to use the pools at the resort.  So, the only way to access the pools is to either book an exorbitantly priced spa day package or suffer through a night staying at the hotel. \nCheck in: HAHAHA!\nThere is a perpetually a long line to check in. Sometimes, there are two desk agents but frequently, there is only one. It doesn't matter what day of week or time of day. You will wait and the attitude is that the hotel is doing you a favor by allowing you to wait. If you don't stay here, someone else will. It's a great way to start a vacation (sarcasm). The agents try to be nice but it is abundantly clear that they are just processing the never-ending stream of angry guests. It's not their fault that the hotel puts them in this position to be the sacrificial lambs and forces them to be on the receiving end of angry customers who have just wasted the start of their vacation in a line.  It's obvious that these employees work very little support from managerial staff.  If I were them, I probably wouldn't care either.\nOkay, the room: I booked two rooms adjacent to each other (301\u002F302). Both were terrible as usual. Yes, the rooms are in the older part of the hotel. Rooms in the towers cost more and I'm sure provide the same sub par experience. Why spend extra to be disappointed. Since I was paying for two rooms and only for the privilege of using the pool I kept cost down....which was still expensive. The resort likes to call these rooms \""Heritage Rooms\"" or \""Budget-Friendly Rooms\"". What they really need to call them is: \""Rooms that we have given up on\"" or \""Rooms that you will not get any sleep in\"". Both rooms are dimly lit and featured a bathroom which resembles a broom closet. The floors in the hallways must be made out of thin plywood underneath the thin carpeting as by the constant sound, you could easily confuse them for a bowling alley or an airport runway. The words Historic, Heritage and Charm are not synonyms for the words Unkempt, Dirty and Falling Apart.\nThis isn't new, the hotel has been like this as long as I've been coming here.  I notice that they try to justify peoples ruined vacations here by telling them to pay more next time for a better room in the tower or that the high nightly rates go towards landscaping.  I don't care how many times they mow the lawns or manicure the trees and I'm willing to bet that most other people don't either.  How about just not having crappy rooms that you know are going to upset people in the first place?  Stand behind your product and fix it if its broken.  Close the wing floor by floor in the winter and renovate the rooms. Blaming the guest for not purchasing the most expensive room at your property and telling them that they deserve the substandard accommodations is just like \""blaming the victim\"" of a crime. \nI was told that the resort was sold to an offshore investment firm a few years back and it's obvious that the only involvement they have in their investment is collecting the money. A shame really.  This place has real potential but not with the onsite or offsite management that is in place.\nIf any real competition opened up nearby with a source to the spring and could create similar outdoor pools, this place would be in real trouble and probably would be closed within the year. And they know it!  \nYour experiences may vary but the best advice I can give is to keep your expectations in the basement...anything above that and you're setting yourself up for disappointment",2,negative

As a recommendation from friends, I chose the West Tower, Lake View room. We chose to Valet. Valet and Bell staff were very nice. We waited quite some time to check in on a Friday. We were on the third floor. The room was clean, but what I would consider very basic. There was nothing fancy about the room, and the furniture and decor seemed a bit used and drab. Everything was earth tone, and right there next to the TV stand\u002Fenclosure was a tiny small white fridge, sitting on the floor, similar to what you would see in a dorm room. I am thankful they had a fridge, but many hotels will hide these in a piece of furniture or something. It just didn't look like it belonged there. We had a balcony, which was nice to sit on and view the lake, however there is a trail that runs along, down below, and you can hear everyone walking on rock\u002Fdirt path. The toilet\u002Fshower area was quite small. The hotel offers pool towels and robes. The towels are the size they give you for the shower, they are stiff, but they work. The robes were quite worn and on the small size. We decided to call down and ask for bigger robes, which they kindly delivered. However, they were the same exact size of the robes that were left in our room. Its quite a maze getting around the hotel, and I found it to be confusing. You can definitely tell when you are in the older portion of the hotel. I found it to be more creepy than charming. There are several windows thoughout the hotel that look out towards the lake, and I found it very odd that these windows were covered in dirt and spider webs. And it was quite obviously these spider webs have been there for quite some time. You would think with a place that prides itself being located in the late, they would make sure the view was crystal clear. With all that said, the grounds are beautiful and the lighted trees add a very nice touch. We visited all pools but primarily only used the adult pool, which was quite relaxing, but also quite crowded. We would have liked to have used the two indoor pools but both times we went, it was so crowded, it would have been miserable.  Please note it is very slippery around the pools when its wet, and I saw at least 4 people slip. The hotel offers tea and cake in the afternoon, but we didn't take advantage of it. On our second night, we were awoken by kids running and screaming down the halls and banging on doors. And this happened several times. This is NOT a quiet hotel at all. Even though there are signs around everywhere reminded people to be respectful and quiet, it just isn't. I never once saw hotel staff or security roaming the halls to prevent this either. My husband and I have most like decided that the cost of our stay, far exceeded the quality of this hotel. Yes the pools are great, but we paid $800 for two nights (including one dinner and breakfast), which was very costly for the quality of accommodations. By the way, when I walked into the resort, I was quite excited, because the check in area, and the areas where they serve the tea are very beautiful. But beyond that, the place is a bit run down. Also the breakfast which was included in our package, was luke warm both mornings. We found the housekeeping staff to be very nice though when we asked for fresh towels and extra coffee packets.",4,positive

The Harrison Hot Springs resort -  a cluster of ugly buildings  - dominates the lake area, and due to an historic arrangement,  is the only place from which visitors to the town can actually access the springs themselves except for the rather grim looking municipal pool. Consequently,  the hotel doesn't feel the need to make much effort to attract or retain custom. Rooms are pleasant enough (we were in an East Wing lake view room and the view is wonderful) but nothing special for the price and could do with refurbishment especially the bathrooms. East Wing rooms are  also miles from the pools due to the odd way the resort has been extended organically with no apparent strategic design plan. It's  higgledy piggledy inside and the signage is dreadful. Front desk staff are pretty disengaged though civil. The hot springs themselves are a disappointment. The pools are small, only one is properly hot (the adult pool), and the changing rooms smell awful. Robes are thin and inadequate and you have to drag your towels down from your room.\nWe didn't eat in the hotel as it was packed with conference attendees and the restaurants are over priced.

Do not, and I cannot stress enough, visit at this time; not if you want to relax, feel and experience tranquility, rest and recover. These buffoons take up nearly the entire site, and act like they own it. Sloppy, drunken people doing childish things, loud beyond belief, including bringing their own speakers to the pool, as if they have never been on vacation before, which might actually be the case. These are the present and future union leaders? What the hell? What an embarrassment! And forget management doing anything because, well, that is a full hotel during low season. Plus, you are warned when booking of the conference, so buyer beware, I guess. I suppose couples like us are irrelevant. Which is a shame; because the various pools are beautiful, and when the buffoons are absent, it can be a very soothing and pretty place. The mineral waters are very good, and I have been to a lot of them. Saying that, I think the hordes of children come summer might substitute for conference delegates in terms of disruption. And, yet, it is very expensive, even in low season. So, what is this place? Is it a retreat, or amusement park? The price-point suggests retreat.

With that said, despite different rooms, the beds were great so we all got a good night sleep. That is until other guests started moving around in the early morning as there appear to have been no attempt at soundproofing between the hallway and the hotel rooms. \n\nThe one thing that really brought down my review, however, was the breakfast experience. The space they use, although big, was not big enough for all the guests wanting to eat in the morning. There were long queues and it felt like every time you arrived to what you were queuing for, you were told that you'd have to wait 5-10 min as they had to cook more. What was even more frustrating was that we had a woman come up to us at our table every 2 seconds asking if we were finished with our plates.

It was so dated and worn it looked like an army barrack. The rug was dirty and looked like it hadn\u2019t been cleaned in the past 3 years. But the worse thing was that it was unbearably HOT!! There was no air conditioning and only one small window. They had one fan that ineffectively blew more hot air around. Harrison was in the low 30\u2019s which is hot...but not atypical for that area in the summer. I can\u2019t believe what a rip off it was! For almost $200, my daughter and I almost perished of heat exhaustion. I barely could get a wink of sleep. And to top it off...they wanted to charge $ for bottled water. That place has been around for a million years and it needs to be refurbished and have proper air conditioning put in as well as ripping out those disgusting dated carpets and splurge on some new furniture! They should advise people that they don\u2019t have proper air conditioning...an infant or elderly person could have become seriously ill.\nThey should be ashamed for charging that price.

So we ended up in what the check in receptionist called their \""newer cottages in the back\""... It was basically an old apartment building that they bought that was a couple blocks behind the resort. I consider a cottage to be a stand alone mini cabin - which they do have on the property - and that, it is not... so I feel like they need to come up with a new name for this part of the property.\n\nThe unit itself: it was pushing 90 degrees fahrenheit and there was no AC. I actually believe she mentioned even the main resort doesn't have AC... how miserable. The thermostat when we finally fell asleep was clocked in at a solid 88 with all the windows open and the fan going. Since we were in a \""cottage\"" it was roomy as it was basically a 1 bedroom apartment. The bathroom was small though and there was no place to set any toiletries down. Minor detail, but the couch was also pretty dated.. it looks like they'd picked up a couch that someone left on the corner with a free sign on it to be totally honest. They also really need to spray for spiders. We couldn't walk up the stairs to get to our unit without walking into a million webs which is when we realized there were tons all over the railing and these were pretty huge spiders by my standards - like half dollar size at least. \n\nThe property\u002Fpools: Our unit was a little bit of a walk to the main hotel. You had to basically walk through the back parking lot.. not horrible, and luckily it was warm enough out, but if you're coming in the winter or fall it might be a chilly little walk if you stay where we did to get to the pools. We came to the pool late - around 10pm and there were still plenty of people in it. The adult pool was packed, so it was nice that they actually close all pools to kids after 10pm so there was more room for the adults to spread out. They do heavily enforce this rule and have someone walking around monitoring for kids which was actually nice to see. I didn't do a lot of research on the hot springs, but when I saw hot springs in the name I was expecting an actual sulfur smelling spring as I've been to a hot spring pool in the past and that's what the experience was like. It is not that kind of pool though it turns out. \n\nFood: We ended up eating breakfast there at the restaurant upstairs before leaving town. Not worth it. They do not do ala carte options so you have to pay $22 for a buffet... and it is a very basic buffet... I feel like if you are going to do a buffet you have to have more than the basics of eggs, pancakes, bacon, potatoes, sausage and a little cereal bar. I'm sure there are better (and cheaper) places to eat in town. \n\nService: They advertise having wifi throughout the resort, but we got out to our room and noticed we didn't get any wifi except one that you had to give a password for. We went through the little welcome book that is left in all hotel rooms that you can flip through and get basic info... but this was so basic all it said was \""wifi throughout\"". So we went to the phone to call the lobby... I am not a dumb person, but the phone was not intuitive at all. No button to call the lobby, dialing 0 doesn't work, nothing set in the directory. So after we got done at the pools we stopped at the lobby to ask what the password was. We stood there for maybe 15 minutes as there was only 1 gal working the front desk and someone who didn't speak good english was ordering food. Rediculous. When we finally got up there she just said \""you don't need a password\"" and I was like \""we're out in the cottages and the wifi you're talking about doesn't even show up\"" and her response was \""oh well maybe try connecting while you're here in the lobby and walking over, but yeah it's probably because the mountains block the wifi signal from out there\"".. huh? connecting to the wifi when i'm in the lobby does no good when you walk back out to the unit. So they really shouldn't advertise it as wifi throughout as we had zero wifi.\n\nOverall, the town is a nice stop over but there's not much aside from the hotel and a couple small restaurants, and the lake of course. If it was actually a cushy, spa-like resort I could see staying there for a full weekend, but I'm not sure I would stay here more than a night.",3,negative

It's old, dingy, and all about hitting you up for more money.\n\nI've been there twice in very different circumstances:  Most recently, I went there this summer with my 7-year-old for a mom-daughter weekend.

At no point has this carpet ever been changed or cleaned since the inception of this hotel. The bed and the balcony were fine, and it was great that they provided a 1.5 foot by 1 foot cube fridge. But seriously? You had to put the fridge on the carpet? You couldn't find a table to put it on? Come on. Then there's the bathroom. Mold is growing on the exhaust fan, and when my boyfriend went to clean up his shaving trimmings from the sink area, the toilet paper took on a YELLOW colour to it from the counter top which has obviously not been cleaned properly in god knows how long. The room was nothing short of disgusting and I can only assume they get away with this level of service because it seems to be full of travellers who are maybe only coming through once, and so they don't care about making sure they get repeat business. This is not how to run any type of business, however based on management's response to people writing reviews, I'm not that surprised. When someone writes a complaint, Gagan's response seems to be \""too bad you didn't enjoy your stay,\"" which is basically saying it is the customer's fault that they think your hotel sucks, rather than perhaps you thinking hmmm if everyone has the same complaints, maybe these customers are onto something and we should investigate what we can do better. \nAll that aside, the tubs are very nice, and we appreciated the lady who kicked the teenagers out of the adults only pool, along with the security guard who as soon as 10pm hit (adults only for the whole pool area), she was kicking every single kid out. Great job to them. \nOverall, complete waste of money and I would not stay here again.",2,negative

We were really looking forward to a weekend of relaxation, de-stressing, and just spending some quality time together.  Did this resort ever deliver!  We arrived on Friday around 3:15 and were able to check in right way (check in time is 4pm).  We booked the Getaway Package which included 2 nights, dinner one night in the Copper Room, and buffet breakfast each morning in the Lakeside Cafe.  We chose a partial lake view room, but I probably wouldn't pay the big bucks for the view again.  Yes it was nice, but we didn't spend much time actually enjoying it.  For us, a pool view would have been nice too and that's what we'll book next time.  After settling into our room we took a walk around the resort and along the lake a bit.  We had dinner reservations that night.   The 4-course table d'hote menu is definitely the way to go; it's priced at $35 and is a much better deal than the A La Carte menu.  Most entrees alone are around $30.  Our server Mark was very friendly and definitely seemed to enjoy his job!  The seafood chowder was amazing!  The Jones Boys are the live band that play during dinner, and they were really good as well.  After dinner we ventured out to the pools which are all so nice!  There are signs that recommend a 10 minutes max dip in any one pool, but no one observed that suggestion obviously!  We would spend 2 hours or more just going from pool to pool.  The one thing we noticed was that the minerals in the pool are quite drying; we were always applying lotion afterwards and drinking water just to rehydrate.  There are also signs saying that beverages are not allowed in the pool area but this was definitely not enforced.  Many people had travel mugs with them, and we will definitely bring some along next time.\nThe resort offers an afternoon tea everyday at 4pm so that was nice.  There is a huge fireplace in the upper lobby which we enjoyed after dinner on our second night.  Breakfast in the Lakeside Cafe was really good each morning.  Lots of selection and more than enough to fill you up for awhile.  Everything is very clean and the service is really good.  We left our housekeeper a $5 tip and she was really appreciative of that; I guess they don't get tipped very often, but they work so hard and we think its nice to give them some extra thanks for cleaning up after us (not that we left a huge mess).\nFor our second dinner we decided to eat in Islands Bar, and that was pretty good.  The village has some options such as pizza, sushi, etc, but there isn't much.  The hotel also has a coffee shop with light snacks and ice cream, but we never went there.  We actually brought a deli platter with us just to snack on throughout the day; this probably saved us some money.\nOne thing we thought was a bit of a money grab was late check out.  Normal check out time is 11am and when we arrived, we asked if late check out would be possible.  We were told we could call the front desk the same morning and they would let us know if late check out was available for our room.  But then upon reading the resort info binder in the room, we saw that even if the room is not immediately needed and you are granted a late check out, they'll still charge you $40!  We decided not to even bother asking, since we were allowed to go back to the pools after checking out; they just give you swipe keys that are only good for the pool area.\nIt was mainly couples that were staying at the resort, but there was also a good number of families with young children.  Kids loved the pools of course!\nWhat else can I say...the service is great, the grounds are beautiful and overall its just a great getaway locale.  We just live in Vancouver so it was only a 2-hour drive each way, but it felt like we were much further away than that!  We can't wait to go back again!",5,positive

We had to utilize all of our towels, robes, and even out neighbors towels to try and soak up the water. We even started scooping it with cups into the bath tub. We then spent some time in the pools while we waited for it to be remedied. After speaking with front desk (whom may I add was extremely helpful and apologetic about the situation at this time), we received a complimentary room upgrade and were told our parking would be waived. But, upon check-out in the morning, when asking about the parking fee, that associate was short and lacked compassion towards the issues we had, and told us that it was only the complimentary room upgrade that they were able to provide us for the troubles.

Decided to bring my kids to the resort for the first time this past August.  We booked a family room which is what I normally do.  My daughter was up all night as she was being bitten by something.  She was covered in welts and bite marks which looked a bit like mosquito bites but these were much bigger.   My son also had a couple of bites.  I talked to the front desk first thing in the morning and she said that she will have housekeeping check the room (I wondered if it was fleas).  At the end of the day, there was a different person at the front desk and she said that the room was checked and nothing was found.  She did have the engineer meet us in the room and even he couldn't see how mosquitos could have gotten in, even through the vent.  However, the front desk offered to change rooms for me and take $50 off right away which I agreed too.  However, I did want to talk to the manager and she told me that the housekeeping manager will get in touch with me.   No one was in touch with me that evening but we changed rooms that night and my partner woke up to bite marks - likely from whatever was biting us jumped onto our luggage and was taken to the new room.   I asked to see the housekeeping manager in the morning.  Lisa, the manager, states that it likely was not fleas but nosiums which are sand flies that come into the hotel.   I showed her my daughter's bite marks and was quite concerned as these welts remain quite swollen.  She assured me that she will have pest control come on Monday and will give me a full report and also assured me that the hotel can do something for me in the future given that my kids refuse to stay there again.  I checked that she had my contact information and she promised to be in touch with me within a week.  No word after the first week so I called a couple of weeks later and tried to get through to her.  I received a voicemail at reception and left a message regarding my concern that has not been addressed.  It's now 2 months later and still no response.   This is poor customer service.

I have visited Harrison a couple of times and stayed in other hotels and had only used the public pool so when I had a few friends coming from Ireland, we decided to splurge and stay at the Harrison Hot Springs Resort so we could access the hot springs and have a relaxing day after a morning of rafting up on Thompson River... BIGGEST TRAVEL MISTAKE I HAVE MADE IN YEARS! \n\nWhere to start.....maybe with the fact that that even though they are hot spring resort and spa where the main draw for guests are the hot spring pools that stay open late, they had no bathrobes left at 5pm on a Saturday. We got to our room to find no robes, we requested 2 plus size and 3 regular robes and were delivered 1 plus size and 4 \""regular\"" robes.....REGULAR IF YOU ARE A SIZE 6! We are a group of different shapes and sizes but I have never seen such a small robes in my life, only 1 person in our group of 3 \""regular\"" sized people could get the robe to close around their body. When we contacted reception we were told \""there were no more clean robes, the laundry was closed and there was nothing they could do..sorry!\"", we spent over $400 for 1 night and 4 of our party were uncomfortable and embarrassed moving around the hotel as their robes did not fit! \n\nWe were told that they buy plus size robes at the start of the season and not again even though they know people steal them and despite the fact that you get charged if you steal a robe. I think it was shocking they didn\u2019t have sufficient plus size robes and only had small fitting \""regular robes\"" for a hotel where the main attraction are hot springs and a spa. There was no mention of contacting the housekeeping to see if there were any robes in empty rooms or the spa to see if they had any spare or clean, a simple \""it\u2019s after 5pm sorry\"" was all we got! I\u2019m sorry but if you are going to keep your pools open until 11pm how can you expect guests to know if they don\u2019t have a robe by 5pm they aren't going to get one...or one that fits anyway! \n\nOur other \u002F main  grievance was that I personally called and booked a 5 person room, when we arrived we were told a cot would be brought to our room for the 5th person, which wasn't ideal but we figured not that big of a deal - BOY WERE WE WRONG! The room cannot accommodate a roll out bed, the bed was placed in the walk way between the door and the sleeping area with LESS THAN A FOOT OF SPACE between the bed and the wall. To exit the room or to get the washroom we had to turn to the side and slide along the wall to avoid the wheels that were sticking out even further than the bed! The hitting our toes of the wheels and sliding down the wall while not the worst thing in the world is extremely inconvenient when you have paid over $400 for a room.....especially when the smoke alarm goes off in that room in the middle of the night and there is less than 1 foot of space for 4 of the 5 adults in the room to get to the door! \n\nThis is a fire hazard, thankfully it was faulty smoke detector and we only had to wait a short time for a technician to come to our room in the middle of the night of to disconnect it. Had this been a real fire in our room, I dread to think what may have happened as we couldn't get to the exit in a timely manner! \n\nI know people will think that this review is harsh but we brought all of this up with the manager the next day. We expressed our extreme unhappiness and disappointment and requested something be done to compensate us for A) not providing adequate bathrobes B) squeezing a bed in and creating an unsafe room C) the inconvenience of having a faulty smoke detector in a room that woke us up at 5am and continued to sound the alarm until a technician arrived and we were basically given comped parking and free upgrade should we ever come back...WE WILL NEVER BE BACK SO WHAT USE IS A FREE UPGRADE? Which is exactly what we told the manager! A member of our group who is project manager in the hospitality construction industry also quote building code about entrance \u002F egress space and that we would be in within our right to take legal action, this definitely inspired a response \"" I will have to get my boss to contact you to resolve this when he comes in on Monday\"".... it is 8 weeks later and we have received no further communication from the hotel. \n\nReally disappointed and angry leaving there especially when they insisted we settle the full bill and it would be dealt with by senior management retrospectively, my friends were visiting from Ireland and we had plans that day so we had no choice after 40 minutes of stating our case but to pay the bill or refuse to pay and deal with legal ramifications of that\u2026. so we paid. \n\nAs someone who works in the event and hospitality industry, I will never recommend this hotel for any event, overnight stay or even a business meeting.

After what I have experienced tonight, I am not too sure if I\u2019ll ever come back at all!\n\nI book a room on West Wing. I have two adults and two kids with me for this trip. The first \u201Cgreeting\u201D that I get is the bad news \u2014 I am told that my breakfast package only includes adults, that my 3 and 6 year-old are being left out. Yes, they charge the kids at a discount. If you want to go down that route, I am telling you that at most resort, at least children under three is complementary. My 3-year-old normally just eat half loaf of bread and an egg. You are charging her for that? Not a very welcome beginning to me and my family. \n\nWhen I get to my room, only one bathing robe is waiting for us. There seems to be a disconnection between the booking and the housekeeping department, as if one of the adult guest is not welcomed to the resort. \n\nAfter we call the front desk, we wait for around 10 minutes just to get the missing robe. The wait time can be avoided entirely if the hotel do a better job preparing what we need in advance. \n\nWe rush to the pool, only to recognize that the water temperature is luke warm at best. Even the most famous indoor pool is not hot enough! I am confident to say that the hot tube at my local community centre has a higher temperature than this indoor pool! This pool is used to be my family\u2019s favourite memory \u2014 we soak at this pool together, competing each other to see how many \u201Cseconds\u201D each can soak before one cannot stand the heat anymore. That is history now I guess... \n\nWe order the room service for dinner. The hard copy of the menu is missing, and a \u201Cbrilliant\u201D idiot is \u201Cclever\u201D enough to replace it with a half-digital version on TV channel 81. Well, it\u2019s half-digital because you cannot control the menu from your TV remote. Instead, they keep playing the PowerPoint slides of pages and pages of menu continuously. If you miss the page (which I did because we needs to pay attention to the kids), too bad! You have to wait ALL the way until the menu loops back to the page that you miss. The choice of the menu items is worse than what I have many years ago. The fresh mussels is gone. The price for the nachos for two is terrible high. Fortunately the taste of the food is still good \u2014 the one and the only good news that we have in the entire night. \n\nThe worst part of the night is the noise level at my room. Apparently the noise level from the outdoor pool is so loud that one would believe there is a poolside party going on! I know that the outdoor pool is closing at 11pm, so I say to myself, be patient, that after 11pm, things will get better. 4 past 11pm. Nothing change. I am so annoyed by the noise, that I have no choice but to call the front desk to ask about the closing time as well as to complaint about the noise level. The front desk staff tells me that a manager will address the problem. Yes, after 15 minutes, the pool is quiet again. It is 11:25pm. I bet if no one make the call, this nonsense will go on until 1am, the closing time for the indoor pool. Unless the hotel address the noise problem, they should consider warning the guests before they book the room on West Wing, or address the guests at the pool and make sure that the noise level is under control. \n\nIt\u2019s such a shame that we used to love this resort a lot. After tonight, I am not sure if I\u2019ll ever come back, nor would I recommend this resort to my family\u2019s member who travel to Vancouver every year.",1,negative

We took a morning ferry from the Island and arrived at about 3.30. We checked in got to our rooms and went for our first dip in the pool. We have had several excellent meals and on Sunday morning had an early dip and packed our bags and went to check out only to find the our youngest son\u201Ds truck which we all travelled in had been stolen overnight and our nightmare began. We had taken all our luggage to the lobby.. When Peter told the valet about the truck being stolen he was told you will have to call the police and he had to ask for a number  and phoned the police. Our eldest son then asked how we were going to get back to the Island and he was told there was no bus service and no shuttle available and he gave him a phone number but no offer to make the phone call. When he called he was told that it would take about a hour for the cab that would seat 5 to get there so now we were in a quandry as we had not been for breakfast. We decided to get a bite to eat at the cafe but didn\u2019t want to leave all our luggage in the way in the lobby so we had to ask the valet and he got a wagon and put our luggage in a safe place which he did. A lady came and spoke to us and offered her sympathy said she was sorry for our loss but no offer to help  I went to the desk to pay the bill which was our treat and on the bottom there was a credit for $10.50, when I asked what that was she said it was because we didn\u2019t charge you for last night as that was the night the truck was stolen. I was shocked. Our taxi arrived and a very helpful driver asked if we would like to stop somewhere on the way for a meal and he would turn the meter off. We thanked him but just wanted to get home. Taxi bill was over $300. We were all shocked by the lack of help.\n    When I got home I went through our bills. The one I paid which I mentioned had a credit of $10.50 but there was no item on the bill for the $10 parking fee per night on any of the rooms does that mean the the parking fee is automatically charged. If that is the case I paid for two nights parking for two of the other rooms. There is also three other items on the bill one POS Taxes 5727 $5.50 the lower down to more POS Taxes both 5867 and one for $8.00 and the other $1.80. what were these for  \n   I have another question,I assumed that paying for a parking fee it would be secure so why do you not have a gate system that would require someone leaving at 2 am would have to identify themself before getting out.\n    Once again we did enjoy the start of our stay but I doubt after what has happened that we will ever come back or refer you to our friends without telling them what happened to us. After coming too this establishment for the past 40 years we expected to at least have some help with arrangement on getting home or even calling the police. How this situation was handled leads me to believe that this is a common occurrence there. As a previous hotel owner I would have NEVER treated a customer let alone a returning customer like that! Something needs to be done on how they handle this situation if they aren't going to have a secure parking lot. They did have surveillance cameras on the parking lot but they were clearly out dated as the film is blurry and only show the truck lights coming on and the tail lights as it was leaving. We weren't expecting to have our stay comped at all we just expected to have help with calling the police and at the very least arranging our taxi to the ferries!       ",2,negative

It is too bad the resort has the monopoly on the hot springs. Current management seems to be coasting on reputation and location, with few upgrades, deterioration in staff quality, raising of prices, and general tiredness to the facilities.

I read many reviews before we arrived, there are so many negative ones so I had low expectations however we had a great time and would definitely recommend!\n\nWe stayed at the resort for my husband's birthday so I wanted our experience to be positive. We booked in a East tower superior room, this is the most expensive room they have minus the suite. The view of the lake was stunning from our room, we could lay in bed and look out down the lake, the room was huge with a separate sitting area, the patio was large with a table and two chairs for us to sit comfortably and the bed was very comfortable. The room had the wow factor for us except the bathroom which needs a serious update. If you like quiet this is the tower to book,or the west tower lake view, especially if there's a conference going on. I heard complaints about noise from other guests who stayed in the west tower pool view rooms and main hotel rooms.\n\nWe booked two massages at the spa which were wonderful. Here's a tip! Normally you cannot use the pools until 1pm the day you check in, however if you book spa treatments earlier then 1 you can go earlier. We booked massages at noon and arrived at 11:15 so had about 45 minutes to relax in the hot springs before our massages started.\n\nI had read mixed reviews about the Copper room so was hesitant to eat there for dinner. We decided to eat off property at Morgan's bistro which came recommended to us from friends. The food and service was amazing and well worth every penny! \n\nWhen I booked our stay, I mentioned that it was my husband's birthday and the booking agent told me they would do something special for him and have something in our room when we checked -in. Unfortunately nothing ever arrived, despite me following up 3 times. It was unfortunate as it's the little things like that that makes a special occasion even sweeter, but they took off the parking charge to make up for it.\n\nThe breakfast buffet was just ok for us. After tip it was $50 for the two of us to eat there and we thought the food was average. Waited half an hour at the omelette station, the line up was so long. We wouldn't recommend and wish we had eaten somewhere else for breakfast.\n\nAll and all we had a great time, I would definitely recommend splurging for an east tower superior room, you won't regret it!

The outside pools are so nice, warm and fun to sit and visit with friends or other guests.  You can then head back to your room, change into your dressy outfits and head for a blast into the past dinner at the Copper Room. It's right out of Dirty Dancing with a live band and dance floor. It's definitely worth trying out and it's a fun night. If you decide to venture out and go for a walk there are great restaurants for breakfast lunch and dinner along the boardwalk along with some great gift shops.",5,positive

At least the East tower was somewhat recently built back in 2009 that the conditions of the rooms at this building were somewhat satisfactory then.

It seemed that the only thing that was left for the hotel is the courteous staffs until our recent incident when we had at the time of check-out. On our first night, the night manager promised us $20 room credit for each day for having to move us to a lesser expensive room due to the dirtiness of the first given room along with a complimentary breakfasts on the first morning as a courtesy for having to move us to a different room after the initial check-in. However, at the time of check-out, the day time manager would not honor the $20\u002Fday room credit, by saying that there was no such note by the night time manager, only the free breakfast was recorded. Instead of checking with the night time manager, she chose to ignore our statement. Not even a hint of gesture that she would try to verify this with the night time manager was shown. I am extremely upset about this behavior of the day time manager. I understand that there may be many demanding guests. However, when the hotel volunteers to offer something to guests to make things right from the mistakes they made, I expect them to honor the promise, instead of making the guests feel like they are just out to get free things.

She gave me wrong info and said the room charge has a $50 limit and that is why it did not go through. \n\nAfter that I went for dinner in the Copper Room and gave it its own review. \n\nTo the pools after and had a great time minus the amount of drinking people do. It gets very busy at night and not everyone is courteous   or discrete with their liquor using a cup and it  is certainly not quiet. What really gets me is the reflection pool which has a sign and most people do everything else but be quiet in there. They could probably use more check ups and a full time attendant. The first night I saw someone in a suite do checks every 30 mins and I thought that was great but the 2nd night after the outdoor pool closed at 11 partyiers carried cases of liquor in and were doing back flips off the edge splashing across the entire pool so no one could use it. They brought in there music and everyone told them not to jump in like that but they never listened. We finally got up and called the front desk on the phone and asked to have a manager come. \n\nThe manager spoke to them and the music went off but then the drunk guy turned it back on and continued to push people in and said we are not diving we are back flipping. The manger picked up cans and I finally got out as I had enough after watching this for 30 mins  and wondered if they were going to leave and as I got out the guy was going through the bag the girl had and I saw 2 more cases of liquor! I told the manager on my way out and he thanked me and went over and it looked like the girl with the cases of liquor was leaving. The other couple wanted to use the hot tub but said oh they are probably going in there now and it will be to loud. Drunk people means loud. We all left frustrated and had it ruined by the partyiers until then we were having a nice quiet time all of us. The door says no alcohol and quiet only.  The next day several others told me they had never seen anything this bad there in all their stays as that night. When I was walking back to the door to get in the hotel I thought what a shame as I looked at the mess of empty beer cans and garbage. \n\nEarlier that night clothed people came in to the pool area and where having drinks out side the warm pool and while I was getting out being very careful on the wet slippery floor these clothed drunk  people saw their friends and came running over drunk and almost knocked me over, I said excuse me and she said we are just trying to get by. No common sense that they had shoes on and should wait and not rush by like that. With this kind of behavior this place really needs a staff always present or a life guard. Many people today have no respect. I personally feel when people are that drunk they should not be allowed in as it puts everyone in danger. \n\nI met so many other nice guests and had a good time for the most part. In the reflection pool many people come in and try to swim and it boggles my mind as most do not know how to swim and splash like crazy so I finally said something to one woman after seeing this about 8 times  as it was painful watching her attempt at swimming and she was incredibly disruptive so I pointed to the sign and she looked at me and  was like \""what\"" and said,  \""it is a swimming pool\"" and I said, \""ah no actually it is a quiet and reflection pool\"". So you had everything going on in there and one lady  was trying to do laps and kept banging into people. Again no common sense people do not read or follow pool etiquette. The big out door pool had several people doing laps and the 4 of us stayed in our own invisible lanes and had no issues. However I can see in the summer when it is warmer and busier  this pool will be a problem too. \n\nI used the outside washroom and never again. The wall paper was ripped and feces all over the toilet. I took a picture and meant to tell the front desk but i forgot. \n\nThe front desk was always smiley and friendly and helpful. They are just busy and have long line ups. \n\nI am just glad I never stayed on the west side as I heard lots of complaints and even someone said they got stuck in the elevator and had to call for help. \n\nI had a salad in the coffee shop and the service was great. The bell boys were great.\n\nI am surprised at how many people travel with dogs and do not understand why they have to take their dogs with them everywhere as they were not well behaved at all. If people can't control their dogs on leashes they should not be taking them. One lady did not even have her own baggies and cut in front of everyone in the front desk line up to get a bag so she could take her dog out which was pulling her. It is not fair to the dog or other guests if your dog is not trained and some people are allergic. \n\nAnother dog kept yelping  around the fireplace as the owner kept stepping on her and it was awful to constantly hear this dog and I jumped every time. Another dog was rubbing its self all over the furniture and carpets at tea time and eating everyone's crumbs. I really did not want it coming up to me. You got several people not wanting the dog and several people who call it and want to see it and the owner just lets it run to end of the leash disturbing people.  I did not think any of this was appropriate. I can't believe how many dogs I saw. It is not really fair to them as they have to stay in the room and if you use the pools and eat in restaurants your dog is stuck in the room. \n\nOf all the hot springs resorts  I do like this one best for many reasons. The Lake Side Cafe definitely needs improvement and I gave that a separate review, the Copper Room missed the mark this trip and the Boutique failed miserably. The pools were great with some hiccups. \n\n4 PM tea and cookies was popular and one can walk around outside and look at the small community and other places close by. \n\nThey accommodated me with a robe in my room this time which is an improvement form last visit where i was given grief over this.",4,positive

I reserved a west wing standard room and had stayed here many years ago and knew what to expect, but even knowing was not enough in this case. The check in experience was very lack luster, the agent (Oliver) was extremely awkward that it made me uncomfortable, he didn't ask if we had dinner reservations, didn't tell us all the amenities of the resort and didn't tell us we needed to pay for parking. He got me to sign some sheet for parking but no where on there did it say $10, and it's not about the money, it's the fact that I wasn't told. We went to our room and it was very dated with a strange layout, 1 queen bed and a single bed, the curtains were stuck so they couldn't let light into the dingey room. We hurried off to dinner at the copper room which was a lovely experience with a live band and an extensive wine list, the food was overpriced for the quality though. We finished the night in the hot springs and it was beautiful and management didn't even kick everyone out until after 11pm (1 hour after it was closed) so that was really nice. \n\nThe following morning we had our morning coffee in the hot springs and enjoyed our last couple hours at the resort. The check out experience was just as strange, I was not given an itemized bill to review first hand, just given the total and the machine, I reviewed after thinking that I was overcharged for something and that's when I discovered the parking charge. I thought about saying something but the agent was too busy chatting with her colleague and I didn't think it was worth it. \n\nTo be honest, if I had payed full price for a room I would have been furious. But since I got such a great deal by any standard it was still worth it to me. I was in hospitality for 10 years prior to my current career and I was actually pretty shocked about the service here. I've stayed in hostels that had better service, so it was surprising for a \""4 star\"" resort. It's very clear that management or the owners don't really care about hospitality, their guests or their pride. I would be very embarrassed if I owned or managed this resort. Yes, the resort is dated but there can be a certain charm to that. Instead of making it their identity and taking guests back to a time of luxury and excitement, they've created a uniquely grungy theme. It doesn't take much, but something definitely needs to change.",2,negative

Our room was supposidly newly renovated, and I supposed the furnishings and decor were newish, but it was rather tacky.  The curtains didn't match the bedding which didn't match the wallpaper which didn't match the floor.  It looked as if the decorators used random bits and pieces.  The pillows were small and cheap and the doors had not been repainted and were all scuffed up.  The uninterupted view from the balcony, however, was beautiful, which got us excited about the spa pools, and we eagerly jumped into our bathing suits and headed to the pools.  \n\nThe spa pools were really nice, although very crowded.  Thankfully there is a pool that kids are not allowed into, although you could hear them screaming their heads off quite clearly from the adult pool!  The whole place was buzzing with activity and it was far from quiet - just something you want to keep in mind if that is what you are after.  Also, the doors to the rooms are not very soundproof and so the sound of kids running up and down the halls yelling was fairly continuous.  There is an adult pool - why not an adult wing of rooms???   \n\nIf you want to take your family to the spa, this is the place for you.  It isn't plush, they can't damage anything in the rooms of value, and there are a million kids around for them to play with.

data\ca\154931\183786\665278864.html,Harrison Hot Springs Resort &amp; Spa,"""Recently stayed with friends and a pet in one of the cabins. Check-in process took much longer than necessary. Door keys did not initially work + our cabin lacked robes. We did soon receive them, including something that I think needs to be praised, as I've never seen this done elsewhere at a pet-friendly resort: we were given a welcome package for the pet. Including a bed, towel, blanket, several bowls, a toy and treats, this pet-welcoming kit was totally unexpected but a very good gesture on the resort's part. Now about the resort part..\n\nUnfortunately, this resort lacks a quality that defines the point of a spa: quiet. As someone has been to other spa & resorts across the country, I found that Harrison almost comes off like false advertising as this resort felt more like a kids splash pool with little to no monitoring. The outdoor pools consist of three various sizes and temperatures, with the furthest pool being the hottest and adult-only. Middle pool is apparently less hot but I never stepped into it because it was always full of kids; there's a reason for this and I'll get to it in a sec. Lastly of the outdoor pools is a cooler one but happens to be the deepest at 4.5-5ft. Barely had anyone in it, so swapping between it and the Adult was the best option. The reason the middle pool was always so crammed full of kids is because it's their ONLY option for an outdoor pool, as there's no shallow enough area in the coldest one. With a bridge dividing up the Adult-Only and Middle Kid-Zone one, their screaming just goes everywhere and you can never fully escape it. Like legit, even in the cabins, we woke up one morning to some kid complaining about his water wings.\n\nIndoors is a designated quiet zone containing a pool and a hot tub but we never bothered to go in there as the pool was also crammed with kids who were screaming. I want to be clear: I'm not saying kids shouldn't be allowed to have fun but if this is a quiet-area of a spa\u002Fresort, where are the staff enforcing this rule? We barely saw any staff doing any kind of noise monitoring whatsoever. If you're going to call your business a spa\u002Fresort, people immediately think of quiet and relaxation: this is not exactly the case at Harrison. As for the cabin room itself, it was great and had all the amenities you'd need plus provided some sense of escape.\n\nNoticing many similar complaints on here, I honestly hope the Hotel looks into installing some sort of automated check-in service to further speed that process up and changes their description to match the more family-friendly service it's offering.

Brief summary\u2026.\n\nToo many large groups (apparently it was office Christmas party season that time of year) of families with young (teenage) children.  They proceeded to get drunk and make noise in the hallways all night long.  In addition, the unruly teens proceeded to cause problems in all the pools (including the \u2018adult\u2019 pools) by throwing snowballs across the pools at one another (causing 2 small children to get a snowball in the face), and also throwing ice balls at the windows of their friends rooms above.  These teens were completely unstoppable, neither by their parents (who were almost worse than they were), nor by any of the other guests (many of whom complained to the parents and staff).  The hotel has zero security set up to control these situations (indeed, the person they dispatched in one instance for security was actually their accountant\u2026obviously although likely a nice man, having little training or inclination to act as a bouncer).\n\nIn fact, the hotel had 2 instances of the police having to be called in to arrest 2 guests that weekend\u2026the assistant manager informing us that they had no system of security in place to do anything about guests until it became bad enough to call in the police.\n\nThe hotel management took very little interest in these ongoing escapades of unruly teens (think \u201CSpring Break at Fort Lauderdale\u201D combined with \u201CMarried With Children\u201D and you\u2019ll have some idea of the atmosphere of the place), and in fact very little notice of the several complaints from guests. \n\nI had my hesitations about going to Harrison Hot Springs Hotel and Resort, having read the various negative reviews on this (and other) websites and newspapers.  However, we\u2019d received a gift certificate, so we went.  When speaking with the Hotel Manager after, as he was brushing off our complaints, I referred to the fact that we were not the only people to feel that this was not the \u2018relaxing, adult\u2019 resort it marketed itself to be (in reference to the other guests also complaining, as well as online reviews).  He informed me that he completely discredited anything found on TripAdvisor because it was common practice for hotel managers to get their employees to write bad reviews of their competitors\u2019 hotels.  Can you say \u201CQuestionable business practices\u201D???  This manager is obviously completely void of any ethics, and really isn\u2019t looking at the long-term damage this type of customer service is doing to his business.\n\nMy overall recommendations\u2026.like many others, I wouldn\u2019t go to this hotel unless you are looking for a place to go with your family.  Children and teens are welcome to go as wild as they like here (in fact, lack of security and interest from management encourages it).  Do not come here if you are looking for an adult environment, a quiet, romantic getaway to relax at a spa\u2026.you will be very disappointed, especially given the prices.  We stayed in the \u201Cbest\u201D room at the hotel ($350 a night) and I would say it wasn\u2019t comparable to a room at any \u201CBest Western Hotel\u201D (or equivalent).  The rooms were very noisy, not renovated, old mattress, and generally not what you\u2019d expect from the most expensive room at a resort.

We have been many times. We just had two days there and it was rather disappointing.  We checked in on Saturday May 18. Our room was not ready.  Check in is at 4pm. You would think rooms would be ready then  We had to wait.  We were given free parking as compensation.  Our room was not cleaned well. The previous guest's food was in the fridge so housekeeping does not check the mini fridge when cleaning for new guests.  We stayed in the Main building and had a family suite, which is a room with a double and a room with twin beds and a bathroom  Usually our view is of the lake.  We had a view of the roof and vents this time. For $300 a night ( including all the taxes), you would hope for a bit better.  The room key cards did not work and had to have them changed a lot.  Breakfast buffet is $22 per person and it is good.  They used to have an omlette station but it wasn't there anymore. Despite this, we did have a good time. The Island bar was very nice.  We would go down with our friends for an after dinner drink.  Great selection of drinks.  We had wonderful weather and sat by the pool which is lovely.  I think the hotel needs some upgrading. Parts are looking a bit worn. Oh, and there were lot's of dogs there too.  So if you're allergic, mayke sure you ask for a pet free room",3,negative

The price and words 'hot spring resort' I think lead people to believe this is a 5 star luxury romantic getaway experience. It is not.  The hotel was built between the 1950's to 1970's, and appears little has been done to it since. \n\nMy room was at the cheaper end, and it was clean, tidy, in a highway chain motel type of way. It came with a fine view of the first floor roof and air conditioning units. I could hear everything happening in the corridor and neighbouring rooms. Three small pillows is not enough for two people, and the hotel may wish to invest in fitted mattress sheets. \n\nCharging for parking is almost guaranteed to upset people before they get to the front door. $25 a day in my case, although others note here $10. There appears no obvious reason for the charge, and most other hotels would include maintenance costs within the room price, so guests are not even aware of it. \n\nDespite only a 60% occupancy rate during off season, there were queues to check in, and the adults only hot pool was packed out. The other two pools were empty, but at the time of my visit largely unheated. The hotel appeals to an elderly clientele (walking frame vintage), which gave it the appearance of an aged peoples home. The lake cruise runs once a week in winter, and there is little else to do in town. \n\nTwo points for location and the helpful friendly staff.

The front desk, housekeepers, guest services, servers, etc were all extremely friendly, accomodating, and helpful. Everybody always greeted us with a smile. \n\nWe really enjoyed the pools. They were a nice warm temperature and there were several pools to choose from. There are also adult-only designated pools. The indoor pool is open till 1am. We thought we'd be able to get some peace and quiet at 11:30pm but it's still packed at that time. However, everybody was friendly. \n\nThe hotel itself is tastefully decorated. Our hotel room in the west wing was a decent size with room to walk around. The mattress is firm and pillows are downed. The fridge isn't very cold so I wouldn't recommend leaving food in there. There's no microwave. \n\nThe restaurants were busy. The food was exceptionally good. Luckily, I had gift certificates for two buffet breakfasts at the Lakeside Cafe & dinner at the Copper Room. The buffet had a wide assortment of choices of fruit, cereals, sausage, pancakes, waffles, eggs, bacon, etc. The Copper Room was elegant and classy. It was nice watching people waltz across the dance floor and the band played an assortment of music. I felt like I was at a wedding. Once again, food and service was excellent. \n\nNow the bad... \n\nThis place is way overpriced. Between two people, the dinner (plus 3 drinks) cost us over $100 (Thankfully my gift certificate covered 3\u002F4's of that). If we had to pay for our room, it's more that I would've paid for. There's nicer hotels in downtown Vancouver for cheaper prices. \n\nYou have to take into consideration that everything you pay for DOES NOT include tax. If you order food, you'll have food tax, beverage tax, liquor tax, GST, and PST (which I think is around 13%). And don't forget gratuity tip. There's room tax.  Parking is $5\u002Fnight. Internet is $8\u002Fnight. Phone calls are at least $1.50. The receipt in the end is confusing. In the end, I paid an additional $50 just in additional fees. To make it easier, they should be including the tax in their prices for their packages. \n\nThe walls are SO thin. The noise level is TERRIBLE. It's a family friendly hotel. There's kids excitedly yelling and running around. The parents themselves are yelling down the hall to each other. Baby's shrieking in the hallway. It's morning of course. Then the last night, we had drunk people stumbling around in the hallway. A girl was yelling how \""[bleeping] hammered\"" she was. Doors slamming every 5 min. Guys yelling. Running back and forth between the rooms. Everytime we were going to call the front desk, they'd quiet down, then start up again 10 min later. This is at 2am. You can hear EVERY word people are saying in the hallway. Our sleep was horrible here. \n\nSo overall... the hotel was elegant but I wouldn't stay here again. It's overpriced. It's noisy.

Yes, everybody was friendly. But parking costs extra per day, Internet is NOT free, there is no continental breakfast, and nobody goes out of their way to provide the extra WOW factor.\n\nI had to carry a ridiculous amount of luggage (not blaming them for the amount, just the lack of help) up to my room - and there is no elevator from the check-in counter to the elevator, which meant I had to drag the luggage up three stairs. Not a big deal, but definitely a minor inconvenience.\n\nAlso, when we asked for extra towels, the lady at the front desk informed us that they were out of towels (which happened every time we asked - they need to buy more towels for sure) - and to come back in 10 minutes. She didn't offer to have them dropped off at our room, which is lazy service at best.\n\n2) Hot Springs - At first, I was wondering what the big deal was. I mean - the outdoor ones feel no better than warm bath water. But by the end of my stay (3 days), I totally loved the hot springs (especially the hot indoor one) and was going in the pools 3-4 times per day.\n\n3) Copper Room - Great dining, great dancing, overpriced...\n\nOverall - I had an awesome time and loved every minute of it.

They host weddings, with quiet time starting midnight. This in itself is ok - what I take issue with is that they don\u2019t offer late checkout the next day after a resort-imposed late bedtime - it was very loud in our room, and impossible to sleep until the wedding ended.

There is no air-con and the room was dark with only one small single window (approx. 2x3ft) that had an obstructed (corridor-like) view onto a a tiny part of a terrace\u002Froof. We then opted to upgrade for a better room since we were staying 3 nights, and agreed to what the receptionist Kelly had said. Additional CAD 90 for each of the first 2 nights, then CAD 120 for another room on the 3rd night since the first room is reserved already on the third night. We called reception on the morning of the 3rd day, and were told we can leave our packed bags in our room and someone will collect it and transfer them to our new room by 2:00pm. We did exactly that by 12pm, told reception (whom was very robotic and simply told us the same thing over and over again, even though all we were trying to do was tell her our luggages were packed...!), and waited at the cafe until 2:30pm thinking it was sufficiently beyond 2pm. After checking with guest relations whom seem to have no idea about our case (we were told to just go there to pick up new room's keys) the manager Nikki came along. She informed us we would have the cabin (which we had previously clearly rejected for a normal room with a view instead) and pay even more for an upgrade. We tried to explain the situation but instead she literally gave us 'the hand' (stop sign) and said it wasn't her fault and she's trying to help us. - To be clear we never used language that blamed her personally, but was trying to explain that we understood the receptionist made a mistake but as guests we shouldn't be penalised for it and pay more! Her attitude of course annoyed us, but she then told us not to speak to her together (my husband only stepped in because she wasn't listening to me). I was asking for a solution, not her telling us that the message in her system had a note to charge us CAD 120 but no explanation of room change i.e. it really was the reception\u002Fresort's mistake). In the end she offered a family suite (two bedrooms), no air-con, but by that point we felt like the Resort wanted us (its guests) to feel like they were doing us a favour instead of having caused us inconvenience. We decided to not stay the third night and paid for the first two nights at the upgraded cost and left. \nThe entire hotel is outdated, old, and only the Cooper Room (restaurant) had an old but nostalgic feel. The pools are ok, but again lack of effort in any landscaping around it, and you have to ask for towels from your room instead of being able to get any at the pools. \nI also agree with the comments already made by other reviewers on lack of signage and that they charge you for parking (and bottled water in the room CAD 2.50).  \nThe only positives are what you would expect from a resort that charges you that much anyway: the breakfast buffet, gift shop staff and activities staff (believe they are outsourced) were friendly, and the location. \nIt's a real shame given the potential the resort could be that they decided to give poor delivery with a high price tag.",2,negative

I try to point that out, and as it often goes, they pretend not to speak English;-( Others are picking their nose , cleaning their ears... and clean up into the pool............yes, adults; I wont mention kids; they behave better then some adults. \n\nThere is a new item in the room - pay for bottle of water. 2.5$ for 200ml; no way. Please, note that water is safe to drink from the facet here; although not indicated ( how convenient) If you worry, there is a small convenience store at the corner of the street - get the water there.  \nI like HHS and I could tolerate the run down hotel - is open 24\u002F7 often fully booked; I understand.... but after you pay 300+$\u002F night for a room only you should not pay for parking. \n\nI am glad to tip the cleaning personnel for their effort; they are doing excellent job. Bed were comfortable and I had good sleep. \n\nAs for the unpleasant guests...is not the hotel fault; although Japan has some strict spa - onsen - etiquette that even tourist have to follow.............\nHence I can\u00B4 t give more then 3 points. ;-(\n",3,negative

Drinks in the lounge took a long time to arrive and were wrong when they finally arrived. Dinner in the Copper room was an experience, it was like stepping back in time, complete with band and dancing. The food was a disappointment with overcooked salmon.

We've stayed there twice previously & had a great time once & a mediocre time once, so we weren't overly excited about staying there again.\n\nThe double room we originally booked was overlooking the lake, which should have been nice. However, it was also right above the dance floor of a noisy wedding (I specifically asked to stay on an upper floor away from the banquet rooms), and there was a tin roof right outside our room, and the leaky gutter drip drip dripped on it so loudly that I called the front desk at 1am to move to another room - sleep was out of the question. I was told I would have to actually go down to the front desk to arrange the move, so I got into my wet bathrobe & went downstairs (which was quite a trek), only to be served by the rudest front desk attendant I have ever met. She told us that she could move us to a room overlooking the pool, & while it was a more expensive room she wouldn't charge us the extra $20 (I should hope not!).

With the indoor and outdoor pools, two different restaurants, the nice big fire place in the big lobby and the tea and cookies\u002Fcake at 4, such amenities all made us feel at times like we were on a cruise docked at port where we could leave the \""boat\"" at will for a nice walk along the lake or through the small and slightly touristy village. This rather nice feeling made us want to come again for a quickie retreat, especially for a break from the unrelenting winter drizzles.\n\nWe booked the \""Taste of Harrison\"" special package, including room, hot-spring pools, a 3-course dinner and breakfast buffet for $209 for two. We arrived Friday at 12:30 PM and were given a room right away even though check in iis at 4 PM. This allowed us to leisurely soak and swim in the cool \u002F warm\u002F more hot pools both indoors and out. \nWe made reservations at the Copper Room (which is a MUST) for the included dinner. \nNOTE: The Copper Room has a dress code of no shorts, running shoes, t-shirts or ripped jeans. Most were dressed for a night out but those of who who didn't fit in just fine...\nWe were surprised at the great service, and the nice meal. (We were in Whistler a couple of weeks before and spent much more for a lunch at Araxi, the restaurant made famous by Gordon Ramsey's Hell's Kitchen a few seasons back; Copper Room's food was as appealing or more appealing visually and happily didn't taste like it was covered in salt like most of our food at Araxi.) Salad was artfully prepared in a nest made of a wall of thinly-sliced cucumbers. A local endive leaf looked like a sail. Steak was cooked just right. Veggies with the entree were fresh and gave me ideas for cooking at home- spaghetti squash over sliced fresh local zucchini, etc.\n I don't usually like live entertainment, but the Johnson Boys playing and singing oldies were a nice touch (from ~7 PM on), as were the older couples dancing on the dance floor in the middle of the restaurant. Fun! We felt like we were back in the 60's or 70's in a fun and warm way.\n\nBreakfast the next morning was fine. Service was good once again. Food and selection more than adequate, but keep in mind that cooking for many is never the same as ordering for one. It was nice to sit and sip coffee, eat breakfast and just relax while looking over the lake. We didn't want to leave the table, but pried ourseves away to go for a walk along the lake and then swim off our large meal.\n\nThe room in the West wing facing the lake had a great view with floor to ceiling glass. The room, while not fabulous, was more than adequate, with two comfortable queen beds and small refrigerator. Balcony overlooking lake was nice. We were surprised that the small shower and toilet room off of the larger sink area had no fan but it was not bad. There were two closets for those who need them. Two bath robes are provided, but when chcking in we were not told that we needed to take our towels from the room with us to the pools. To replace the wet towels with dry ones, take them to the front desk. Apparently people had been taking 3-4 towels each when they were kept by the pools leaving the resort short of towels at times.\n\nTIPS: If wanting a Lake view and quiet room, I would suggest asking for the top 6th floor on the far west side (away from lobby). On the east side near the lobby, we heard one or two loud groups parking for check-in. But it was not a big deal and didn't happen after about 9 PM. I also did need to ask the younger guests staying 4 to a room across the hall to please not shout down the hall. They complied and all went well.\nLower second and third floors may have views blocked by trees.\n\nOutdoor pools were delightful with nice views of the hills, mountains and trees nearby. One smaller pool was for 18 year-olds and above. All outdoor pools were for adults only 10- 11PM. \nWhile we were there, the sun was out and it was a great place to relax and get some natural Vitamin-D!\nIndoor pools were also nice with the high designer wooden ceiling with large sky-light and nice relaxing spa music playing softly. Steam rooms are small for no more than 4, but were not used much. Indoor pools opened at 5 AM and we want to go early next time to enjoy the peace quiet and solitude hopefully as a nice way to start the day. \nSpa looked very nice,  but we did not use any of those services.\n\nAter checking out, we walked to the back of the property to find the \""more rustic\"" cabins with 1 BR and futon in living room along with small wood-burning stove and little kitchen that were cute and a similar cost of the less-expesive rooms in the hotel. The cabins felt a little more private and were just off the outdoor pools and the Copper Room but separated by a gate opened with a room key. Pets are allowed at the resort  but those staying in these cabins were allowed at no extra charge. The cabin we went in (being cleaned) had no pet odors and was not bad at all, with the same amenities as the hotel but with a completely different feel. There was no full-on  lake view, but there is a slough in the back with picnic tables looking over this \""pond\"". \nThe path to the pools also breaks off and goes through  gardens  to another gate nearby. that opens onto the gravel path along the lake. This easy access to both lake and hot-spring pools without the need to walk through areas of the hotel where many other guests gather, should you not feel like mingling, added to a feeling of privacy. We want to try this alternative way to experience the resort next time!  \n\nLiving in Metro Vancouver, one of main reaons for this trip was to see if this would be a good place to escape the winter doldrums. We feel it will be, most definitely! We were comparing it to Whistler, a similar distance away in the other direction. Because we are NOT skiiers, Whistler can be great fun in the off season, but when weather is colder and snowy in the mountains, we can hopefully escape to Harrison without the need for chains, etc.",4,positive

We didn't even ask for this, she went out of her way to get us a room right away.\nStaying at the resort actually made you feel like you were somewhere far away; outside the hotel building there are gorgeous pathways with ponds, statues, fountains, and quiet\u002Frelaxing places to sit and enjoy the scenery.

Our waitor was great, he was always close by, and even grabbed our camera and took some photos of us dancing without us knowing - it was a fantastic experience. The price we paid for amazing food and a fun atmosphere was less than other popular restaurants - we were shocked. It's worth going up just for the Copper Room dinner.

Harrison Hot Springs is still the gem that I remembered.  For us, the pools were the big draw.  There is something for everyone in them, temperature and size-wise.  We also loved the gardens with the ponds (complete with frogs and tadpoles), and the hiking nearby.  I was pleasantly surprised with how family-friendly the resort was.  We had a lovely time, and my kids are asking to go back!",4,positive

We had a good time, but in general we all felt a bit let down. \n\nThe staff is generally confused. The front desk clerk booked me into a lakeview room, but put me into a hill-side view room. She told me the outdoor pools were open until 11pm, but they tried to kick my kids out at 10pm - which is their policy, and that's OK, but the clerk knew full well I had kids under 13 so she should have been explicit. \n\nThe hot spring pools are lovely, to be sure... but actually, the \""hot pool\"" was a little too cool and the hot tub was a little too hot! The indoor pool was a great temperature, but not great for young kids (quite deep). There are loungers and chairs around all the pools, which is nice. \n\nBelieve it or not, this hotel centered around pools does NOT offer pool towels!!!\n\nRoom service was mediocre and very expensive. There is a restaurant on site where we ate three times. The first dinner was OK, the next morning for breakfast we were seated and then never saw a soul... no server, no menus, no coffee, nothing. Thankfully, we just helped ourselves to the buffet - quite good - and they knocked something off the bill when I left (my instinct to leave without paying was over-ridden by my conscience, so I had to ask the hostess to find me our bill!). Breakfast the next day was fine, so it may have been a staffing issue. There is also a fancier dining room that looked very nice, with dancing\u002Fdinner music, and is apparently quite child-friendly but I didn't want to test it!\n\nWireless internet did not work in the room, had to go to the lobby. \n\nThe room was small, a bit dated. Huge closet, though, and a separate sink area from bathtub\u002Ftoilet which helps when everyone's getting ready at the same time. \n\nI'm not saying don't stay here, but if you can ask for specific rooms, you might have a better stay. Ours was in the north tower... I think if you stay in the other section, you'd have a better room. Some have balconies directly overlooking the pools, with very nice wooden patio furniture. A few are even pool-side, but they front the adult pool so if you have little kids they can't go right into the pool anyway (and I don't think there were railings around those patios, so if your kids are really little it might be dangerous to stay in those rooms anyway)\n\nOne word of caution: check your bill when you check out. I just left the keys in the room and walked out, but I just discovered that they have somehow overcharged me by at least $100. I'm still on the road, so can't check the details - I called the hotel and asked them to email me the bill, which they said the would do but haven't after a week and a-half. $700 for 2 nights and a few buffet dinners is waaaayy more than it should have been!\n\nHarrison Hot Springs is a cool little town. The beach is nice, and so is the lake. Lots of little restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. \n\nThere's also a little coffee shop\u002Fdeli in the lobby.... great baked goods, picnic lunches, coffee, etc. A nice touch.\n",2,negative

We stayed in the East Wing and the room was great; quiet and nicely decorated. About average in size. Not worth the nightly rate for the room alone but you're really paying for access to the pools which made it worth it. There are 3 swimming pools; one outdoor kiddie pool about 3 feet deep and kept at body temp, one outdoor cooler pool great for hot days, and one indoor pool at body temp. There was also an indoor hot tub and an outdoor adult only hot tub. All were fabulous and my kids had a blast. The hotel staff was all very friendly. We arrived before check in time and couldn't get into our room but they gave us a key to the pool area which was great. We only ate at one of the restaurants once but it was great.

We were pleased to find most of the patrons there to be adults... there were some kids but they were well behaved for the most part and I didn't find them to be any trouble at all.\n\nThe person we booked our rooms through was very helpful and quite competent.  He even took our reservations for the Copper Room to save us time.  Checking in wasn't too much of a problem either, although it was a bit of a wait as there was only one person behind the desk and an elderly lady butted in, not quite understanding the concept of \""standing in line\"".\n\nI've read previous reviews of the hotel and had almost cowarded out of booking here, but decided that we might have a good time anyways with lowered expectations (which turned out to be a good thing).  We stayed in the main hotel and found the rooms more on par of what I'd expect out of a 2-3 star establishment... not really what I'd expect for $150.  And man, the walls were super thin!!  I could hear the guests above our room walking around (and I'm certain I heard evidence of intimate relations going on).  We could also hear our neighbour's tv and every morning the guests in the room on the other side of us (next to the wall where our headboards were) we would wake up to their morning conversations.  This was our absolute biggest complaint as we were on holidays and therefore wanted to sleep in!!  When we mentioned this during check-out the receptionist confirmed they knew this problem and tried to justify it with being an old building and upgrades could only do so much.  She also mentioned that the east tower was much newer and more soundproof.  Now reading another review I'm under the impression that the walls there are just as bad.\n\nWe loved the breakfasts at the Lakeside Cafe (my bf is such a sucker for buffets).  Especially the fresh fruit they had there were delicious.  Dinner at the Copper Room was also good, although we were told that the restaurant had a formal dress code (ie,  no jeans allowed and jacket a must for men).  So we got dressed up (*VERY* reluctantly on my bf's part) and when we got there we found some guests in very casual wear, including jeans and sweatshirts!!\n\nPools were great, especially the adult-only one, we'd probably used them at least twice a day.  Really enjoyed the hiking trails up through the woods.  But because it was during off-peak season almost all the stores on the strip were closed so there wasn't too much sight-seeing.\n\nAll in all, we had a really good time.  With the exception of not being able to sleep in due to noisy chatter next door, we got to be very lazy and will chance another trip this November... my fingers are crossed the East Tower will make a better stay.\n",3,negative

We stayed in room 459 in the West Tower, overlooking the lake - amazing view!\n\nThe room was clean and pleasant - we had our own balcony and it was very quiet. There was no alarm clock in the room, which was odd. The bathroom was also a strange configuration - there was a huge area for the sink and vanity and then a separate, teeny room with the toilet and shower. The door into the toilet\u002Fshower area was narrower than a normal size and the whole arrangement was very cramped and uncomfortable. \n\nThe shower itself was great - rainshower head and really lovely stone tile with underfloor heating, which made it very cozy.\n\nWe couldn't get 3G service or the free wireless in our room - not a big deal if you're there to unwind, but we both needed to check in every now and then, so it was a bit of a hassle. In order to get cell service or the wifi, we had to go down to the lobby. Fortunately, the upper lobby had many comfortable seating arrangements and we each enjoyed a latte from Miss Margaret's as we caught up on email.\n\nWe happened to be in the lobby for 4p.m. complimentary tea and it was a mad house! The real pros had staked out their spots for about half an hour beforehand to be first in line. It was a fun, casual atmosphere, with folks wandering around in their robes, fresh from the hot springs, eating cake.\n\nWe had a very nice dinner at the Copper Room - the live music was great and while we're not big dancers ourselves, it was a real pleasure watching other couples cut a rug on the dance floor. The food was above average and we both enjoyed the wine! So much wine...\n\nMy wife is a spa afficionado, so I booked us both in for some time at the Healing Springs Spa. We did the couples' soak, which was amazing - so relaxing and lovely. I had a great facial and my wife had the full day package - she was almost spa'd out by the end of the day! Her only complaint was that her massage was pleasant but not nearly hardcore enough - more of a \""rubbing you with oil to flute music\"" massage than a \""work out your kinks\"" massage. The staff were all super friendly and accommodating.\n\nWe finished off our day with a soak in the pools. Very quiet and comfortable and really loved being outside in the light rain at twilight...kind of magical. A wonderful way to end the day.\n\nThere didn't seem to be much around the hotel restaurant-wise so in the end, we ordered room service for dinner the second night and it was very good. The room wasn't really set up for room service though - we had to steal the mini table from under the mini fridge to eat our meal and it all took a lot of juggling. Would have been easier if they'd just left the room service cart as a table - maybe we'll ask for that next time.\n\nSpeaking of next time - if we *did* return, I'd maybe try out the East Tower, 'cause it's newer and the beds might be more comfortable. I don't usually think of myself as a fusspot when it comes to beds (although I notice complained about the hotel bed in my last review too) but the king bed in our room was more than firm. It was like sleeping on a board. Even after a day of relaxation at the spa and soaking in the pools, we could not relax on this thing. We tossed and turned most of the night, barely slept - it kind of killed the experience for us a little bit.\n\nI would go back - it's a short drive from Vancouver and the room rate was reasonable - but the bed, bathroom and bad wifi were deal breakers for my wife. So I would recommend the hotel with the caveat \""This place is great if you're not particular about those things.\""",3,negative

This though was the first time we would be staying here. When I booked the room, I said I wanted the best one available with a lake view. I had remembered going last summer and requesting to look at the room they were offering us that was around 250. When they opened the door I would not even go in. It was so tiny you could barely move around and very dark. The only window had a dark grey cement wall view. We stayed somewhere else that night. I found out unless you pay top price the rooms are old tiny and outdated. Bedding included. I asked if they had any with a kitchen or a  jacuzzi.  I was told no. I reqested the best of what they got with the view and was put into the east tower. Just before I left I called the hotel to see if check in was 10 or 11. That is what it is for all the hotels I have stayed in before. It was 4p.m. When I questioned why Im paying for a 24 hour stay and not getting that I was told that is what its like in most hotels so they are no different. Yeah. Okay. I thought. Not true. But whatever. She then proceeded to say that we can hang out in the pools until then. Now the question is. If  check out time is 11:00 a.m. and theres no way around that unless you pay extra to stay till 4p.m.... why do we have to wait till 4? When we showed up around noon, throughout the lobby there were people with their bags sleeping on the chairs as they could not get in their rooms. It kind of had the effect of homeless people on the streets in some aspects.. We were very fortunate though as our room was available.  Our room was beautiful. It had a stunning view and a large king bed and was roomy. There were no flowers on the bedding. The T.V. was old and I thought that was funny as Im sure they could afford to upgrade to some flat screens. We decided to get something to eat and  found out the copper room wasnt open till about 6p.m. So we decided to order room service. We found out we could not do that either. THAT wasnt open till about 4 p.m. We then found out the Lakeshore Cafe was open so we bolted up there. The breakfast buffet was over but they had real food we could order. The food that came was excellent and the service was next to none. A little later I decided to got get a pedicure and headed to the spa. I was really looking forward to some pampering but this was not to be. They were booked solid. I was upset by that because though I mentioned to the hotel when I ordered the room that this would be something I would be doing when I get there, as well as the clerk when I checked in, neither told me that I would have any problems getting the pedicure done. Since that was not going to happen we headed over to the springs. This is beautifully put together. The grounds are gorgeous and if you really like the springs you can actually book rooms on the ground floor that you can literally step off from you balcony and into the pools any time you want. I would think that it would be noisy though as when we went anyway it was so VERY packed. When we went into the hot tub indoors, it was like a sardine can. Not very much room for anyone to move around. The indoor pool is quite small too. I thought it would be like the one outside next to the copper room. This is not the case. Later we went to have dinner at the copper room and got seated right next to the dance floor. It was a great seat if you want to dance which we did. The four course meal is a excellent deal and again the service is next to none. The jones band has been there for years and does an excellent job and they will requests. Unfortunately they dont do anything new age so you will have to stick with what they already know how to play. In the end we had a great time. If they did the changes with the decour of the rooms, check in times, and better communication this would  be a four star hotel. But i give it a 3.",3,negative

When you see something offered for a certain amount, and you agree to accept that offer, you don't really imagine that you will be actually sold something completely different.\n\nI don't have any major complaints about the hotel itself, and if nothing else was available, would probably not mind staying there again if this hadn't happened. Since it did, I will not be able to trust them ever again. \n\nThe garage had a small pond of water close to the center of the garage with a sump pump being used to drain and control it. I noticed the plug for the pump was only about 3 feet away from the water. If that cord had gotten placed in the water someone could have been seriously injured or worse. \n\nWe've been to Harrison before, and will be coming back frequently because it is only a few hours from where we live in Washington State, and because we like it up there. But because of our experience with them, this will never be our favorite hotel.",4,positive

We had to check back two times until our room was ready which was fine as we walked and enjoyed checking out the town.  Once we got our room it was downhill from there on..........on both of our beds their was black hair all over the sheets and pillows and we went right down to the hotel check in and I asked to see the manager.  I showed him the photos that I had taken, but better yet I wanted him to see the hair in both beds first hand and he followed me with another employee.  It was obvious that these beds were NOT CHANGED!  He said they had a hard time keeping good housekeepers.  This is not my problem. They gave us another room which he inspected first hand with me before finalizing. This room was clean and fine.  He did say he would be working the next day and take care of me at check out. I did inform him that imagine you were the guest and your family had to deal with this.  Well, it did not end here.  My daughter and I found we only had two towels, two hand towels, and one wash cloth. I would recommend to get extra towels before you find you need them.  My daughter was disappointed too when the next morning the sauna was not working. She reported this to the desk and they said the employee forgot to turn in on as she was new.  Needless to say at check out my daughter reported it was not working and all they could say was that it was before. We also reported upon check out that perhaps they could clean the ceiling fans that are full of dust, cracked, and obviously water stained from prior water damage.  I could say more, but I won't because I also know the manager is trying his best since he took it over to improve this hotel at least that is what he said. I do believe him since he did come with me to view the hairs in the bed and instantly said that he would give us another room and inspect it too.  My daughter and I told him that we plan to send him what I would call a laundry improvement list of things to do from a customer stand point if he truly wants to stay in business and make a profit, let alone have repeat customers. First comes training employees to dress professionally and this should really be looked at (the manager was dressed professionally and he should have his employees follow a certain standard), stop blaming other employees for management failures on guests complaints, and such. He was responsive to us sending him this list and repeatedly thanked us for offering this, which we will do soon to help him know we care.  I will say this, he did reduce our bill and this was without even asking. He did do this on his own and a fair amount which showed that he does care as a manager.  We understand it takes time to do improvements, but improvements should be done before taking over a hotel and the tourist season is going to peak and this is when your customers become your best word of referrals, so I truly hope that the staff can be paid a good wage to do their job with proper training, and management that cares to reward their staff with the best benefits they can afford to keep them employed so they don't experience turnover.  Hopefully, once he receives the list he will respond and follow through with some immediate changes and long term planning for some larger improvements.  One thing that I would suggest right now, is offer coffee and water in your lobby for your guests.  This alone can go along way and not cost a lot.

But it was a quite inexpensive for a short getaway, so we went for it. \n\nWhen we checked in the receptionist was really nice and pleasant. I asked her if the amount for the full stay was accounted for, with tax included. She clearly stated yes at the time. She advised us that we did have to lay down a $50 deposit for any damages (which we totally understood). She advised us that the $50 will be waived when we checked out.  This seemed like standard procedure, so we agreed, and she gave us our keys.\n\nFirst Night: The room that we got was a single queen room. I must say it wasn't bad until we saw the washroom. It was tiny. The door barely cleared the toilet bowl and the rack was almost falling from the wall. So, I made a mental note not to touch that rack at all. After checking the rest of the room, we set the fan\u002FAC to cool down the room before heading out for the evening. Thankfully when we returned the room was cool. First night Check!\n\nSecond Night: This is where it went downhill. Around 3-4 am I heard a rumbling sound in the room so I decided to investigate and found out that it was the A\u002FC. I was wondering why it was like that so I checked the temperature and it was still sitting at 16 C so thinking that everything was okay, I went back to sleep and didn't think much about it. Around 7AM we woke up and started to feel hot and again we checked the thermostat and it was still sitting at 16 C. At first we thought that maybe it was just the room being directly in sunlight, so before we went out we set it again to 16 C (which is their lowest setting) and left it to cool down. A few hours later we returned expecting a cold room just like it was last night. Boy.....We were in for a surprise...IT WAS LIKE A SAUNA !! The thermostat still read 16C, but it was hotter than it was outside! Even the hallway was way cooler. \n\nAt one point it got so unbearable that we went down to the front desk to seek for a resolution. We explained our situation to the young lady present and was told that no mechanic was present in this hotel that evening. However she said that we can switch our room for another one. We gladly took her suggestion and quickly moved to the next room. Our new room was visibly newer than our old room, which is always good. Kudos for that young lady for helping us. She was nice, smiling and pleasant. \n\nFinal Night: Our new room was a little better than the old one, except the washroom was just as small. Luckily, there was no broken towel rack or peeled wallpaper. The AC wasn't as cool as the first room (when it worked), but it was definitely way more bearable. Again we set the temperature to 16C but the room felt a little warmer than that. So we just stayed on it till we checked out. \n\nWhen we checked out the next morning, we had to call at the man sitting in the office before we could get any service. It seemed like we were bothering his daily routine, because when he walked to the front desk to serve us, he had no smile and seemed impatient. Again, because we received a deal via Social Shopper, we didn't want to complain too much, but at this point we just wanted to wrap up our vacation and check out quickly. Without asking about our stay or why the room was different, he proceeded with the paperwork. He confirmed that the $50 deposit will be waived, but surprised us when he said that there is tax on top of our initial coupon purchase. We explained that the first lady that checked us in had said that everything was included. He then grabbed the voucher and with an annoyed voice, pointed at the paper and read out the line stating the taxes were extra (we did not read this paper beforehand). He told us that the lady that helped us was new and didn't know what she was doing. I don't have a problem with paying at all but with his attitude and clear annoyance that it wasn't the taxes that riled me up. At this point I shrugged and paid the money because I didn't really want to deal with this rude person at all. After all the help that the other receptionists did for us. I didn't want this guy to ruin it all.  \n\nConclusion: It would seriously take us A LOT to consider coming back, with or without a coupon. The room was dated and drab, and with the air conditioning being down on the second night, it really was an unpleasant experience, especially in this hot weather. The washroom was close to being claustrophobic and the unresolved signs of wear and tear did not convince us that they cared much for the customer's experience. The sauna and exercise facilities were unfortunately under maintenance when we checked on them (who knows how long it's been down for?). The only redeeming factors were that the rooms were quite clean and well-stocked, a decent rate (via Social Shopper), two very helpful receptionists that responded to inquiries quite quickly (not the last guy), and the location was accessible to the beaches and restaurants. Would appreciate it if the staff were all clearly informed of all promotions beforehand so we would not have to encounter an awkward situation (and the unfriendly guy!).",2,negative

This is a nice place to revisit again in our book. Harrison Hot Springs is certainly a very nice an pleasant place to be...either some R and R or try out their exciting boating\u002Fwind surfing outdoors activities...At night there are different places to dine..and  they are all within walking distant ..but we chose to dine at the restaurant on the main floor of this hotel..They offer a good variety of  choices  on their menu for a reasonable price and we\nLike their food...we couldn't ask for more...Again we were greeted and serve by this wonderful and friendly waitress...All in all, was this trip worth it to us??...I can say this trip wa as happy accident ...from a disastrous first day stay at Harrison Mills to an unexpected wonderful stay in Harrison Hot Springs..especially with the decision we  made to stay at the Hot Springs Villa Hotel.. Just like happy accident in photography..when one don't expected to get that awesome shot and got it...I can say about this trip..will we come back and stay at the  same place...a big Yes...I didn't get my Eagle shot like I did last November but I got some really cool close up sharp shots at the lagoon  of song birds feeding  off live critters...it's worthy of publishing it.",5,positive

We had a broken ironing board, but no iron?? The main wall looked like it had water running down it at one point and left stains behind. Its a nice location and building, however it is shameful the way it is not kept up. Don't waste your money. And don't expect to get sleep unless your the top floor.

We got in and no one was there, suddenly there was a lady who came in to help us and had no clue of what the resort name even was. Eventually, she was on the same page as us. Shortly after, Raza came in (the manager). He came in and him and the lady where arguing with each other so loud - they were literally screaming at each other. I felt so uncomfortable standing in the middle of this.\nAnyway, the lady had just gotten up and walked out of the room and then Raza was helping us (barely). As she left, we heard her banging on someone else's door just across the hall screaming \""It's 11:00 you are past check out, GET OUT!\"" At that moment, I was sure I did not want to be there. I felt so uncomfortable. Raza took us to our room, (the room they gave us was not the one we had paid for, but we decided not to say anything because this management already seemed so sketchy and confused)gave us a quick tour and when I asked for the room key he said, oh I forgot it let me go get it, which is totally ok! 15 minutes go by and Raza has not yet come back with our key so I get a little but concerned, as all my stuff is in my room now and I still don't have a key. Minutes later, I hear screaming again, I peep my head out of the door and there is Raza with that lady again yelling and screaming at the top of their lungs. I go over and ask Raza if he's gotten my key. They both stop arguing, look at me, completely ignore me and go off fighting again.\nAnother 10-15 minutes pass, Raza has not come with my key yet but I see that lady outside my room so I just simply ask her to get my key for me. She said \"" I will stay and lock your door after you leave and you can get the key later on.\"" Some people may be okay with that, but personally I just didn't feel comfortable leaving my things in a room that I wasn't sure would get locked - also I didn't feel comfortable leaving my hotel without a key. Anyway, I told her, no thank you. Please get me my key for the room, I will lock it myself. She immediately started yelling and screaming at me at the top of her lungs. She was verbally abusive towards me and I was so stunned at the fact that I had been at this place for less than an hour and I saw the way the management was speaking to each other and then to customers as well!\nEventually, Raza came up with my room key, I locked up and left.\nMy friends and I came back to the hotel around 9:00pm - and there is a sign in the hotel saying after 10pm there is no noise allowed. Which is understandable! So it's 9:00pm, my friends and I are in the hotel room, we had a few of our other friends with us as well but, we are completely mindful of the time and noise, as I live in an apartment myself - so I understand what it is like to be bothered. \nRaza comes over to our room, (keep in mind that it is not 10:00 yet) he is obviously not sober and he is screaming at us so loud! Yelling at us to get out, get lost, etc. We just ask our other friends to leave because Raza was acting completely unprofessional and honestly very scary! I literally thought he was going to attack someone. Our friends had left our room and then Raza comes back at 10:15 and is yelling once again. He continues to yell. \nThe next morning I wake up to see a $200.00 charge on my credit card. When I called Raza he said, \"" instead of $200, I should charge you $500.\"" \nAt this point, I am just so sick of being here and talking to him that my friends and I just pack up and get ready to leave.\nThis place was an absolute wreck.

It was unfortunate that their best suites have the worst views.  Also, not impressed with the old non-HD TVs (with no possibility of pay per view movies) and poor wireless internet.  Harrison isn't a typical nightlife destination so I thought I was safe to assume I would be able to curl up with a new release movie during my stay.

The suite is clean and is equipment with fully stocked kitchenette which is very helpful. We are amazed by how thoughtful they are in getting every little thing we need to cook. We don't feel a big difference than how we cook at home. We got a very enjoyable stay due to this homing suite.\nThis hotel is right on the beach and is the closet hotel to public hot spring pool. We went to public pool two times by walk during our 2 nights stay. We also took a relax walk along the beach in the morning.\nThe only problem for us is that the wi-fi signal is not strong at our floor and the internet speed at night is terrible. Probably due to the cable vendor they chose. As a heavy iPad user, this is really something I hope they can improve. But in considering the price they offer and the quality of the suite, I have no complaint.\nIf you like to cook and you don't want to spend big money on the food you don't like, choose this hotel with junior suite.

The hotel is centrally located on the beach and just a block from the Oktoberfest venue at the Queen Anne event hall.  \n\nI was disappointed on check-out when I found a fee had been added to my bill ostensibly because the hotel has chosen to use environmentally-friendly cleaning materials.

Was welcomed with a chilled bottle of champagne and chocolates in the room. (add-on)\n\nStayed in a junior suite with a mountain view, only because the lake side was fully booked. The 4th floor had a decent view of the mountain, but also of the parking lot and buildings across the street. with our window open we could hear everyone at the hot tub below, but closed it was quite quiet. There also isn't a door to the bedroom so sound does travel between the rooms if you're traveling with someone else. However, the light from the windows doesn't reach the bedroom which makes for a great sleep!\n\nThe furniture was well kept, I'm assuming the couch and chair were wrapped in sheets due to it being a pet friendly unit! The fireplace and kurig coffee maker with starbucks pods were an unexpected feature. The bed was quite comfortable and there was no shortage of pillows or blankets. Our suite didn't have a bathtub which was disappointing, so perhaps check before you go (the website just says either\u002For). \n\nEnjoyed having a 2nd TV in the bedroom, the range of channels is large - but if you're needing more there is a library of dvd's to borrow at the front desk for $2\u002Feach.\n\nThe hotel doesn't offer room service however does have a relationship with the restaurant below (Morgans). We ordered a nice dinner and dessert for takeout one night and they plated in on actual dinnerware and said to leave the dishes behind which we appreciated. \n\nWe will definitely stay here again and just book a day pass to the hot spring.",4,positive

The hotel is attractive and well maintained and staff were friendly and welcoming.\n\nWe had the Queen Room with 2 Queen Beds.  The room was spacious and clean and the beds very comfortable.  There was a gas fireplace which created a nice and cosy atmosphere.\n\nOur only criticism is that the large windows covering about the top third of the wall do not have blinds or curtains, letting in a significant amount of light from the streetlights, lit-up trees and hotel outdoor lights.   We did not sleep well on the first night due to the amount of ambient light in the room.  Fortunately the second night we were so tired that we slept regardless.   Our room was on the 4th\u002Ftop floor and it seems like the offending window is an architectural feature of the top floor - possibly rooms on lower floors will not have this problem.  We did provide this feedback to the hotel and hopefully this is something that they will rectify, as in all other respects this is a great establishment.\n\nThere is a fridge, microwave, kettle and pod coffee machine - suitable to prepare snacks or simple, light meals.  We had morning coffee, light breakfast and sandwich lunches in the room, and in the evenings dined out at the restaurants within minutes walk from the hotel. \n\nThe water from the town's hot springs feeds the public (indoor) pool - a 5 minute walk away.

It was out first over night trip with our 1 year old and I am so happy we chose the Harrison Beach Hotel. First off the value. It's a huge suite with solid wood doors (very important when you have a toddler who needs to nap in the dark) with breath taking views of the lake at an affordable price. Second the location is perfect for enjoying all that the hot springs has to offer. Third the staff is absolutely wonderful and friendly from the manager to the front desk to the housekeepers. Angie in particular went above and beyond. I forgot my curling iron that I needed for a work function and she brought her personal one from home to the hotel for me to be to use. She was a life saver and its just a small example of the above and beyond guest service this hotel offers. I highly recommend this hotel. My only tip is for travels who like to eat organic, shop before you come. The room has great amenities and the grocery stores are relatively close but they do not offer a lot in terms of produce. Other then that the trip was wonderful and I look forward to staying at this hotel again in the future.",5,positive

I must say it was clean though, but I think we were the first people to use it in a long while.  It has no jacuzzi or exercise room.

It had dishes and cooking utencils, but I don't think there is much use for them since you can't cook much in the tiny micro.  The garbage can in the room was so small we could not fit our take out containers in them.  The beds and pillows were ok, but not the most comfortable.

Upon arrival, the crib was there but we were given a room different from what I had reserved over the phone (I was told we would have a balcony and we did not until I complained).  One of the only positive things I can say about the Harrison Beach Hotel is that it is the only place in town that carries a baby crib.\n\nWe stayed for 4 nights and found housekeeping to be slow and dismal.  Towels were dirty, our bed was made without a blanket, items like coffee sachets were not replaced unless we asked, etc..  The kitchenette utensils and mugs were also filthy.  We also found that we could hear other rooms very easily.\n\nOverall, I feel this hotel would have been \""okay\"" if we were paying significantly less.  I think that the high rates they charge and the impression that the website gives do not accurately reflect what the hotel actually is.

Now that we\u2019ve been, I\u2019m super happy that it was and we stayed at the Harrison beach hotel instead. \n\nSome of the hotels look a little dingy in the area. Not the beach hotel. It\u2019s bright, clean, and welcoming. It\u2019s located right in the middle of the Main Street, making it a perfect location. Directly across the street is the beach and the lagoon ( which is where we chose to swim as the water was warm and shallow for the kids.) There is also a nice playground right across the street. \n\nThe staff was friendly and accommodating ( running us up extra coffee for the keurig in the morning when we needed it.) The room setup was perfect for our family. A good size clean bathroom with a nice line of shampo\u002F conditioner. Then there is the semi private bedroom. The linen was clean and soft, the bed was decent with extra pillows. There was enough room that I could easily fit our playpen for our baby in the corner. \n\nThe main area is a good size. The kitchen has everything you need. The pullout was comfortable and the kids slept great on it. The blackout curtains ( important for my early risers) made the room nice and dark.\nI said a few times I wished there was a broom as we somehow managed to track in a ton of sand, and then found there was one in the bedroom closet as we were leaving. \nI would also recommend grabbing groceries in hope or chilliwack as there wasn\u2019t much for grocery stores around. The market that\u2019s right there is what you\u2019d expect, pricey but handy. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if the room we had can be booked with a balcony, but if so, I\u2019d highly recommend getting a balcony. They looked huge and had an amazing view. \n\nWe will probably be making this a yearly trip as it was perfect for our family of 5, and we will definitely rebook at this hotel because I\u2019m sure that there\u2019s nothing better out there, and at a reasonable price as well.\n\nThe pool was clean and the kids had fun, they also liked the outdoor hot tub. The gym was super tiny, I think it had 3 pieces of cardio equipment. If you\u2019re into that, just go for a job along the beach instead. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for for restaurant recommendations, we really enjoyed the pizza place right behind the hotel.",5,positive

I believe the biggest disappointment was waiting excessively at the front desk while staff talked on the phone discussing both private business and personal issues in front of us. This happened twice. A more professional practice would be to ask the non-guest on the line to hold or tell them they had a guest waiting and they would call them back. We felt like we were burdening front desk staff by simply checking in and out. We have stayed at the hotel in the past and had great, friendly service, that is why we returned on our recent visit.

Thankfully just a few scratches so we said nothing but the door just goes down so a word of warning. The rooms and facilities we ok to good, clean and maintained. As for the building, it is wood frame and you could hear everything between the floors. The people downstairs came to bang on our door when we arrived at 9:30 because we were being loud. Just arrived and brought our stuff in and yelled at within 5 minutes. The fact is cheap laminate flooring did not help the situation as most hotels have some sound proofing and carpets. I hate carpet but better than water damaged laminate planks. The pool and hot tub were clean enough but small. The exercise room was small and had some equipment that was out of order. The location was awesome, the view was great, the proximity to the water and the park, restaurants, shops is really great. We did not feel upset or that it was a bad stay but felt like the hotel was not to our standards in general.

It was just unfortunate to see the peeling wall paper, rusty sinks, musty smelling cupboards with dishes that smelled the same and carpets as well; all indicators of a place that needs some TLC. It would be great to see a place like this get the updates it needs and really offer a comfortable overnight experience, given its location and potential. ",2,negative

Even though it only cost $89 mid-wk and $99 on weekends, I knew there might be a problem since I was unable to get a room at many of the other motels in the area.\nFirst off: The good is it is right on the main drag and a 30 second walk across to the lake and in the hub of many restaurants.  It  was also fairly clean for being as old as dust itself!  The owners are asian but not real friendly and don't understand english very well.\nWhen I first walked into the room, there was a dirty futon so close to the door that you could barely walk around it and on the other side of the futon, going into the bathroom and bedroom, you have to turn sideways to make it thru the walkway.  The futon slides down off the frame about 6\"" making it difficult to get around it and also quite uncomfortable!  The water faucets have a \""water hammer\"" ( Loud thud when anyone in that building turns off any faucet in their unit) which woke me up whenever anyone used the bathroom and can cause the pipes to break if not fixed causing alot of damage!\nThe so-called \""full kitchen\"" had no salt &  pepper (which most kitchenettes even carry).  The bowls in the unit were so shallow, they looked like saucers (worthless). The people before you washed the dishes by hand so who knows how clean they are? There was no microwave and the old appliances were from the 50's era, and the 19\"" tv was on top of the refrigerator!  The front door had a turn button knob on the door and no dead bolts or other type of security.\nI tried to sleep on the futon but it was very hard and uncomfortable so I switched with my friend and took the bed and IT WAS WORSE!  The lighting in the living\u002Fkitchen\u002Fbedroom areas were very poor so I couldn't even read.  The bedroom had no dresser and an old fold-out closet door opening up into a 3' closet.  That was it for places to put clothing, bathroom equipment and coats!  Also, NO AMENITIES!\n\nThe last of 5 nights, we left and went to Exec.

I regard myself as one of the good guys, noting any action taken is chosen carefully, with an excellent memory for unique detail.\n\nLike a lot of people, I like to support a few things. I choose to be quiet and go about it in a manner that sees me give a little each and every year.\n\nSo last October, I got what I thought was a great deal, in buying a room deal at the Skagit Motor Inn. I bought other things at the local event attended, and paid roughly $35, for a room, that I planned on using for a guest or work associate coming through the area. It was in an envelope, so I merely paid my money and took it home and put it away for use sometime in the summer.\n\nMy time to use it got me by surprise, with a young hitchhiker of all things. They were well dressed and had headed out far too late and had no chance to get to their destination. With a bad storm and darkness heading in, I thought I would help, as I had this room and it was a young person, that really was poorly prepared to be outdoors, while enroute to somewhere in the Okanogan.\n\nSo I grabbed my little envelope as a show of good will to help this young person. I took the young hitchhiker to the Skagit Motor Inn and proceeded to open my envelope. I was pleased with myself as I thought I was doing a good deed on a night where no one should really be outside. I figured that even a good hedonist like myself might score a few points if there ever was a heaven otherwise I was simply not comfortable with having them to fend for themselves on a night where a big storm was going in.\n\nMuch to my surprise I was shown that my voucher had a date, that was only 2 months past when I bought it. I spoke to the gentleman at the desk and told him, the organization and that I was merely helping this young person (well spoken, and simply a tired traveller) and would take full responsibility of course. I was told that they would do nothing and he pointed to the date.\n\nGiven that I was humiliated and promised this person, I paid $110 + for the room, on this late July night. My voucher was worthless. But I helped this young person. I could have went somewhere else, but I was flustered and not impressed.\n\nI told the gentleman at the time that I would pursue this when I had time and that it was in poor form. Having a voucher with what was a 2-2.5 month period was simply a waste of both my dollars and has me rethinking who, how and what I donate.\n\nI took the time to submit my outdated voucher to the organization that had it as a charity silent auction event, and have yet to recieve a reply.

Cleaned up grounds that are tidy and spacious. Cared for landscaping.- The improvements visible from the outside coupled with its enticing location at the end of the town\u2019s riverfront with an easy side street walk down to the Fraser convinced me to give them a try in place of a pass. I wasn\u2019t disappointed. We got a stand-alone FIVE ROOM cabin with two bedrooms, a real wood burning fireplace in the living room, and a good size kitchen. All for the price of a room ($94) at many Hope motels. We also enjoyed these updates inside: Wi Fi. Individual controlled electrical controlled baseboard heat in EACH room. Fantastic quality mattresses and pillow with crisp clean linens, real cotton quilts, and many extra towels in the bath. Spotless cleanliness in every nook and cranny. Some of the old charm still remains from these probably 50 year old cabins, like real tongue-and-grove wood walls, wood paned windows with trim and sills, and a hand carved arch. It be nice if they\u2019d restore a bit more. For instance, you can see in the kitchen and living room that there used to be larger picture windows, which were covered over. They should open them back up for the natural light and better ambiance. The kitchen furniture could use an update to a simple table and four chairs over the charming but not comfortable hand-made bench seat and table combo. Add a ceiling fan in the bathroom (so often missing in older facilities), and a chair to the living room and this place would make a great spot for taking in the areas sport and hike offerings. If they combined the modern improvements, cleanliness, and just a little restoration to the historical features, I\u2019d stay for longer than over night and make a short holiday of it.

I would have rathered sleep outside in the rain... naked. \n\nI entered the room with fairly low expectations (I have stayed in cheap motels before) however, I was completely unprepared for the horrors that lie within. I entered the room and immediately see more dirty dishes on the counters than I have in my entire house. I also see grease covering the stove-top and the range hood, but it was OK because I was able to draw a smiley face in the grease with my finger. \n\nI was further disgusted when I went to use the washroom and noticed that there was used soap left in the shower, and there was a nest of baby spiders in the tp... but at lease if I got hungry there was protein for me.  Then, when I got out of the washroom, I found that there was a Tim Hortons cup left on the side table... it was so thoughtful for the management to leave me the last half of their coffee! I asked the staff to remove the trash and they came down and took it away, but seemed quite \""put out\"" by our request.  \n\nAlso, the towels had dirt all over them. I am pretty sure they took the used towels and just folded them again. But the worst part about the bathrooms was that 1) the shower had only ice for water... liquid ice that would scorch your back with burns of excruciating cold as you curse the hot water handle for not working. 2) when the upstairs room turned on their water, it sounded like a lion was awakened from it's slumber and was on the hunt for human flesh...  \n\nFinally, when my wife and I went to go to bed, we looked at the sheets and found crumbs and stains all over the sheets. So, I went to the management and asked that they change the sheets... however, I did not trust them worth beans by this point. So, when the management said that they would come and change them, my wife and I decided to go get drinks, but as I said, I did not trust them. So, I left the corner of the blankets turned up and made mental images of where the stains were. Then, when we came back after about and hour and our sheets were not changed, I went to ask the management if they would do it then. However, the management insisted that they had changed the sheets and that there was nothing to worry about. However I insisted and they refused, so I asked for a set of sheets to change them myself and they reluctantly gave them to me.  \n\nAll this is to say that no one should ever stay at this motel.

Exactly why we were tucked into this awful hole is unclear since it did not appear the motel was anywhere near full on this Monday evening in the second week of September.\n\nAt first glance, the room doesn't appear to be too bad. It is a good size and contains a refrigerator and microwave, as well as a coffee maker. Free wifi is advertised. It doesn't take long for the flaws to become apparent, however.\n\nWhen I first signed onto the internet, I connected easily. Then I clicked on a link for a flight special that was due to end that night, and waited. And waited. Two hours later something came back to life and the page completed its loading. Needless to say, trying to research the next part of our trip was hopeless.\n\nIn the meantime, a young lady (presumably a daughter as this appeared to be a family-run business) came to our room with a mis-matched coffee mug, as only one mug had been provided. When we asked if there was a problem with the internet, she grabbed my MacBook Air (no permission asked or given) and began shutting open programs in an attempt to \""find the internet connector\"". After poking at keys for many minutes she declared there was internet - and there was, for about 30 seconds - just enough for her to leave the room. \n\nThere is a toilet and bathtub\u002Fshower in the bathroom in reasonable condition. The door opens slightly more than 45 degrees before jamming against the floor. \n\nThe sink is on the other side of the bathroom wall hidden by the microwave is on the counter next to it. \n\nThe main door to the room also jams against the floor.\n\nIn spite of the size of the room, the bed is situated against the corner so that access is only available on one side, or from the bottom of the bed.\n\nThe bed itself was sad. Very sad. Draw a large breath and it squeaks. The bedspread was limp, the bottom sheets were fitted but so thin\u002Fworn that when I drew the bedspread back, the bottom sheet came with it. \n\nThe sound of water draining from another location indicated that the pipes came through our room, next to the sink.\n\nNo tissues or hair dryer are provided.\n\nI really didn't want to touch anything as this is the sort of place that gives you the feeling that cleanliness is not a priority. I couldn't bring myself to sit on the stained couch.\n\nOverall the impression is that current management is out of its depth. Perhaps they will learn.",2,negative

This time, however, I really felt I should review them.  We were given room 227, which was great!  They gave it to us at the single queen bed rate for this time of year, which was $65.  It has a king-size bed and is very roomy.  Any, since it isn't located in the building to the rear of the lobby building--where the crews usually stay---it \""should\"" have been quiet.  NOT!   The manager's private area is very close and unfortunately, it appeared they allowed children to run up and down the hall outside our doors until 12:30 a.m.  So we didn't get to sleep until after that hour.  What a disappointment!!!  \nNow, about that king-size bed (and any of the queen-size beds we've previously used):  These are basic quality beds.  That means they aren't broke down, but their \""padding\"" is minimal.  If you need a bed that is supportive--this is it.  But if you need a bed that is supportive AND also somewhat padded so you don't get sore spots from pressure points that are against a hard bed--these beds aren't for you.  I always wake up sore.  But this is a problem the managers could solve very easily.  Many motels are upgrading their beds by putting on the foam mattress toppers (such as the ones that Costco sells) and the difference is heavenly.\nIf these managers would do the same with the beds--and enact some kind of curfew on the kids running up and down the hall (they weren't shouting or anything--just tromping up and down and giggling), this place would be hard to beat.\nWe've always found it nice and clean.  Would be nice if they offered a decent continental breakfast but they offer nothing.  We can do without that, but it is still a nice touch.",3,negative

We checked into the Lucky Strike on the 22nd of August. The young man at the desk seemed overwhelmed and not actually sure what room was available. We were given Room #1. The room was not clean, smelled musty, however as it was late and we were tired, we thought we could rough it out for one night.  \n\nAs my son was getting ready to get into the shower, there was a terrific crash, and my son fell up to his knees thru the floor in the bathroom by the toilet. The sub-floor was completely rotted out. Needless to say we would not be staying in that room. My son was terrified. We informed the  young man at the desk of what had happened and he came and saw the damage. He was not pleased and intimated that somehow we had caused this damage. He then reluctantly put us in room #2. When we asked if there was a fridge in room #2, he said no. We asked if we could leave our food in room #1. He said no as they were going to be working in the room. I then said, \"" at 9:30 at night?\"" he said yes. At this point we knew they wanted us out of there. We went into #2 and it was more dirty than the previous room. The mattresses on the beds were awful and when we moved the beds to see if we could put an air mattress on the floor for our son, it was clear those floors had not seen a proper vacuuming in years. \n\nAs we were moving our belongings from #1 to #2, the young man came back and said \"" sorry this room is reserved, you can't stay in it after all!\"" At this point my husband lost it. He said surely there is something you can do for us? Surely there is a room, my son fell thru your floor, what are you going to do to make this right?  The young man said the only room they had left was a room with a king size bed, but that they ONLY rented this to couples without children. I asked him what he thought my child was going to do to this room as he would be asleep for the duration of the stay in the king size bed room? He said, no kids in that room. He was not allowed to rent it to anyone but couples and besides, we could not have it as it costs more, and they can get more from it. I said surely in this case, as good business practice, couldn't we just get that room. He wouldn't budge and became more and more angry and belligerent. AT this point we decided to check out. I went to the office and got a full refund. And again, he said, he cannot rent us the more expensive room, he was not allowed to. I reiterated the fact that my son fell thru your bathroom floor and could have been seriously injured,  you should be doing everything in your power to make this better. Again, the young man did nothing. \n\nAs I and my husband moved our belongings back to the car as quickly as possible, the young man went into room #2 he then came out and in an angry voice said, did you move the beds in there. We informed him that we had moved the bed to place an air mattress on the floor for our child and BTW, our child fell thru the floor of their bathroom and they have not even fostered a suitable apology as of yet. At this point the father of this young man came out of the hotel. No doubt drawn by the angry words that were being exchanges by my husband and this young man. The father\u002Fowner of this establishment did nothing to make this situation better and entered into the argument with my husband and his son. I could go on, but I won't. This was one on the worst hotel experiences in my life, not to mention, have I mentioned it, my son falling thru the Lucky Strike Motel Floor.  When we checked into the hotel next door, The Royal Lodge, that actually was clean, tidy and pleasant and live up to the advertisements on it's marquee, I immediately called and cancelled my credit card. I did not trust that these hotel folks as far as I could throw them and thought that they might try to charge the broken flooring to my credit card. So don't stay here.

They went out of their way to ensure we had the right room for us at a good rate. Room itself was immaculate and the bathroom spotless. The bedding was of above average quality and attractive.

The room was clean and recently updated. The hotel is conveniently located right in town. We found it to be clean (zero smoke smell) quiet and well appointed with comfy beds. The manager was very friendly at check in, and communicated everything necessary. I\u2019d definitely recommend the motel, and would stay again if I were in the area.",5,positive

Close to \""downtown\"" restaurants, bars, sights, etc.\n\nPrice seems high but I guess it really isn't given the prices at other local hotels.\n\nWill likely stay here again.",4,positive

Great for families and great value for money.",5,positive

Very clean, comfortable queens beds, nice linens and pillows. \nGreat front desk service with Denise, so helpful!\n\nOnly thing I would recommend is adding a sheer to the front drape to let light in but not open view into the room.",4,positive

data\ca\181784\583905\71293812.html,Park Motel,"""Stayed here for 3 days because the reviews said it was reasonable and clean and had a kitchen. We were traveling for 7 weeks so we needed to cut expenses and do some of our own cooking. The kitchen had only a couple of dishes and 3 pots that were so filthy I wouldn't even consider using them.After our first night stay we toured the area and returned to our room. It was never touched!! We complained to the owner and he gave us clean towels and emptied the garbage.The next two days they never cleaned the room-never vacumed-never cleaned the bathroom. This is the first hotel I have ever stayed at where they didn't clean the room every day. If you want a clean room -DON'T GO HERE!!!",2,negative
